""The theory of evolution was introduced by Charles Darwin and it baffled the world.
 
Going by the same principle as Darwin's theory all living organisms by nature are capable of evolution to an extent.
 
Evolution in games are always just limited however this is not a game but rather reality.
 
However the only thing that stagnates the whole premise of evolution is the environment.
 
Environment is always the number one factor of evolution. 
 
Going by that logic. Stimulation for survival is needed to evolve and better suit the environment. ""

21033,The Girl Named Rino,"Oh. Hello. I didn't see you come in. 
No, don't worry. I don't need to hear your name. I already know what it is. I also knew that you'd come up at around this time. 
But, at the same time, I also didn't know.
It's very hard to put into words - but that's what happens when you become the Chaos God. Your psyche gets messed up, big time. That's even more so for me, who was already warped enough to confuse reality with imagination - and, even make the rest of the universe believe that it was so.
But, enough about me. Let's talk about you. You seem to come from a very far away land. It's faint, but your presence is there - in a relatively primitive planet. No wonder, no one wanted to stay in, or conquer your region of the universe - there's nothing worth controlling there. 
Your existence, much like your entire solar system, also seems to be pretty insignificant. Tell me, is your race capable of destroying your own world? Oh, you're already well along the way? Global Warming? Pollution? Overpopulation? Nuclear weapons? Wow... it's been many millenia since I'd last heard of such ancient concepts from someone who is actually living through it. 
Still, good job getting that far. That means that your world is now, at least, worth considering as a possible place to install a World System. If I find the time, I'll try surveying it. You can just thank me, later.
Oh wait! What kind of person am I, not even offering my guest any hospitality. I'm ashamed. 
Please, take a seat. What would you like? I have everything the multiverse has to offer, whatever it is you want - I can get.
Ah! After we talk, would you mind, if I asked you to do me a tiny favor? There's this girl, I want to keep tabs on. She's in one of the Worlds that I preside over, it's called Aiarthe. But, for some reason, I can't see her - not directly, at least. 
All I need you to do, is check up on her from time to time. Whether you do it as a pure spectator or through someone else's eyes, is entirely up to you.
Really!? You would!? Wow! Thanks! You really did me, a huge solid there!
For agreeing so quickly, how about I get started on surveying that planet of yours, right now!?
You can help yourself, to anything in the fridge!

21039,Infinite Lives Online,"This slice of digital depravity is an introduction to my much larger GameLit world: Infinite Lives Online.
I can’t post more than this due to Amazon's rules, but I felt that the meeting of a weary gamer and a zombified NPC could still be enjoyed in isolation from the rest of the book, so I’ve made it available here as a short story.
Hope you enjoy ;)
P.S. If you fancy some more, the full book is free to read on KU. I've included the synopsis below…
 
Winter is coming, is it? Well, if my shrivelled-up little energy bar is anything to go by, I’d argue that it's already f***ing here. Trust me, the infinite lives hack seemed like a good idea at the time.
What I wanted was an escape from reality. What I got was the Lord of the Rings on bloody amphetamines. A glitching garbage-fire of a game. As I write this, I’m trapped in a Red Zone, with a horde of unstoppable murder fiends, a clingy nemesis, and a pack of players who couldn’t give two tugs of a Donkey Kong’s you-know-what whether I live or die. The wrong end of my flaming sword keeps catching fire. The only NPCs who want to have sex with me are members of the Gnome community. And to make matters worse, I can’t log out.
Um, I did mention the tank full of heavily armed soldiers in mech suits who just arrived, right? I am so screwed…
Warning: “Infinite lives” contains swearing, stats and violence, the FPS occupation of a fantasy MMORPG, a hung-over gamer girl in a mech suit, a chainsaw wielding Amazon, sleazy Zombies, an evil Necromancer, the most pointless artifact ever, characters with unbelievably inappropriate avatars, an ad-saturated cyberpunk future, an excessively violent horde, inappropriate workplace behaviour, a drunk Wizard with a ring fetish, weaponized Gnomes, non-PC NPCs, and possibly a melee à trois.
More swearing than Ready Player One. Less words than Lord of the Rings…

X-1 is action packed, unpredictable and full of colourful characters
Authors note:
This is more of an experiment than a proper fiction. There are no real central characters and is basically coverage of a fictional racing series. I did it a long time ago on a forum and some people found it kind of interesting. I thought I would do it again and see how it goes with a general audience.
It's worth noting that I don't actually have control over the race results, it's all generated through a custom made simulation.Give it a try and who knows, it might be enjoyable.",1
21042,Assault The World,"NOT ANOTHER WUXIA KNOCKOFF

This is my first venture into writing for fun, and I'm hoping to keep this running until I run out of juice. With that said, I very much enjoy dungeon core novels, and wanted to do one a bit outside the norm. Hope you enjoy!

21057,Vigilantes Make Us Safe: Rebel Rebel,"When the world was on the brink in the 1940s a group of men and women with uncommon ability pulled the world from the brink. They inspired generations to come and led to a golden age of vigilantes protecting the world.
Times change. By the early 2000s almost nowhere was willing to tolerate unregulated men and women dispensing their own form of justice. The dawn of the internet made operating in the shadows virtually impossible.
Everyone thought the days of vigilantes were done but presidential candidate Richard Hughes, riding a wave of populism, has promised to bring these men and women into the light and empower them to keep us all safe. The passing of the Vigilantes Making Us Safe Act changes everything.
All teenagers feel like they don’t fit in at times. Ryaan Asfour knows the feeling well. As part of an immigrant family in a country turning against immigrants, there’s a lot of people who don’t think he belongs.
The election of Richard Hughes and the passage of the Vigilantes Making Us Safe Act hasn’t helped matters. Suddenly anyone who wants to discriminate can just say they’re keeping people safe and do whatever they want.
Sudden popularity at school after hitting a game winning shot makes it even more apparent how much he doesn’t fit in with the rest of his world. A clash with a pair of vigilantes on his way home from school puts things in perspective. What can Ryaan do to protect his family and his neighborhood?
 
Vigilantes Making Us Safe will follow a variety of lead characters including Serenity, Toxic, Hitbox, the Rebel and more. I'll keep the cover image and title updated to reflect the current protagonist but I encourage you to check them all out.",15

Note: This story is not a typical fanfiction. It is mainly an authentic work. This story only uses monster names/appearances, names of locations and the orb-matching strategy combat system from the app game on android/ios. The rest is original, which means prior knowledge for readers is not required. The app game has no plot, and this work also has no relation whatsoever to the anime aired starting in 2016. The goal was to create a story using these monsters, giving them personalities and purposes beyond just images and stats.",35

Nonetheless, I kept on running and killing the ones that attempted against me until I died—I was killed—I was freed from my arduous life. Perhaps that was what I had wanted all along, why did I not let them kill me way earlier?
I wanted my life to be reset. I wanted to experience the things I couldn’t enjoy when I was working and escaping.
My wish was fulfilled after I died—I came back to life. I could start all anew, in an unknown age and place, but with a body that wasn’t mine. However, my ideal form of living, the one I yearned for, wasn’t something that could be easily attained with the background I was born or if you were someone that thought too much.

Warning 1: This story covers very mature themes which I have listed here: Torture of a child (The MC is the victim), death, killing, slavery, and light gore. Nothing sexual ever occurs to the main character.
Warning 2: This is another apocalyptic LitRPG, has a brokenly OP MC, bad writing, horrible grammar, and garbage sentence flow. It is my first attempt at writing a story since grade school.
Inspired by my four favorite stories: Overlord, CLANNAD, The Arcane Emperor, and Tokyo Ghoul.
A note by me: This is not a world domination story or an action story. There is fighting but it's not the focus.
Another note by me: This is a work in progress. I’ll likely go back and change stuff a lot.

21220,Mother of Learning,"Zorian is a teenage mage of humble birth and slightly above-average skill, attending his third year of education at Cyoria's magical academy. He is a driven and irritable young man, consumed by a desire to ensure his own future and free himself of the influence of his family, whom he resents for favoring his brothers over him. Consequently, he has no time for pointless distractions or paying attention to other people's problems. As it happens, time is something he is about to get plenty of. On the eve of the Cyoria's annual summer festival, he is killed and brought back to the beginning of the month, just before he was about to take a train to Cyoria. Suddenly trapped in a time loop with no clear end or exit, Zorian will have to look both within and without to unravel the mystery before him. And he does have to unravel it, for the time loop hadn't been made for his sake and dangers lurk everywhere... Repetition is the mother of learning, but Zorian will have to first make sure he survives to try again - in a world of magic, even a time traveler isn't safe from those who wish him ill.

21221,Gently Tormented,"((DELEATED.)) 2024

Quietly lying in the dark, his arms are wrapped around his own frame as an attempt to comfort himself while the tears that formed from his swollen eyes fell in sync of his staggered breathing. His crying was quiet. Soft sniffles and heavy pants, which would gradually calm to inhaling and exhaling to try and relax himself even though the pain that remained was unbearable. He was so young and naive, he didn't know much other than knowing that if he were to make a sound they may only come back, and only make his inflictions worse. Only after the pain would go down, and the tears stopped, would he then slowly fall into a deep sleep.

Helm.Online, a Virtual Reality Massively Multiplayer Online game boasting “Grounded Virtual Realism” and “An Immersive Reality Unlike Any Other”, takes the world by storm, becoming a resounding international success.

They stand at the forefront of a war against primordial, cosmic beings known as The Nevermore who seek to break the inhabitants of the virtual world. 
Kazim is fed up with hearing about the hit game. Having played many games in Virtual Reality, he writes off H.O as another boring addition to a quickly oversaturating market but the phenomenons’ constant media barrage eventually stimulates his curiosity and he finally joins the millions of players in the fight against The Nevermore. 
There, Kazim discovers Helm.Online’s unforgiving and random nature and immediately struggles to find his footing.
But, with the help of three new friends and an impending in-game event, Kazim just might find a way to keep the game from kicking his ass and have some fun while doing it.

Summary:
Just the story of a necromancer and his eventual army.
Currently, the only major thing of note is a pretty fleshed out magic system. No set list of spells or specific incantations. Just rules similar to the laws of physics, within those laws you can do whatever is possible.
 
 
 
Updates:
I work Sunday thru Wednesday and updates tend to revolve around my scheduled days off. Currently, I release content as I feel it's ready for release because that's what I myself would prefer from an author.
Warnings:
This story is graphic.
blood/necromancy magic that requires self-harm to use. 
explicit descriptions of sexuality. (though fairly tame outside of the marked chapters, at least compared to said chapters)
and is generally darker in tone.
If you're concerned you might start to read only to be turned off by these elements.
See
7. Teetering on the Edge for an example of the graphic nature of violence or
9. Explicit Content for a fairly self-contained example of the most explicit of the sexual content.",77

Reader beware this is a rough draft and that means that the grammar is going to be ...spotty.  I will go back and edit chapters at a later date. I am working on getting a better editing program. If you spot grammar errors don't be shy and tell me. It might take a while for me to fix it as I am busy writing and working my full-time job. I promise you I will fix it though and I deeply appreciate those who point out errors that I can fix.

She wishes nothing but a happiness that was snatched from her by fate. She wishes nothing but a role to play; big or small. She wishes nothing a small fraction of satisfaction life can offer. She doesn't want to fight for her fate or to defeat someone. She just simply desire to give her self the smallest value for someone who is alive for the second time around.

21262,I Was Reborn Just To Be Killed?,"I used to be a simple 23 years old student. No particular achievements, living with my parents, no girlfriend.
If there was one thing I liked about my life, then it was writing and reading novels. Regrettably, I was too half-hearted (and maybe not talented enough) to make a living this way.
Despite all of that, my life was a comfortable one, or so I thought.
Little did I know that one day, after falling asleep on my desk, I would die. I have no idea if it was a heart attack or something else, but I should have died back then.
Now, the problem at hand. I’m glad to have discovered that death isn’t the end of the run, but I don’t have time to be happy about that.
Was it about four years ago that I awakened in a different world, in the body of the eight-year-old me? Anyway, after I was declared as a ‘Scourge-Class’, I somehow managed to survive up until now and I’ve understood a few things about this weird world that I’m in.
In brief words, this world appears to have a setting that is a mix of all the stories which left the biggest impression on me in my past life. That includes the ones I read, wrote, and even the ones I had only daydreamed about. However, that’s not the most important thing at the moment.
Right now, I’m going to attempt the craziest thing I’ve done in both of my lives.
We’re going to escape this damned place and from the Scourge-Class, we’re going to become Disaster-Class.
The friends whom we lost in those four years… we are going to avenge them all.

I still hadn't edited that one and it's low on priority. I may come back to it if I'm in the mood.
Most of the portions of the story will NOT focus on the skills, stats, grinding or battles. More about the dialogues (or the internal monologues) and the MC interacting with the world (or glitching, if you name it.).
...
With parts of his memory lost, Takeshi, a 25-year old lazy office worker was transported to a game world. Using his casual knowledge on video-game mechanics, join Takeshi's journey as he discover more about the world, his companions and himself. (only if you're interested though.)
My personal review: from ch-2 on expect a lot of perversion going on. It can be pretty weird, like the MC want to be a girl and Y*ri other girls, Fut*nari folks, Traps, the mention of t*ntacle monsters and some lulzy display (like shoving a morning star up someone's b*tthole in retaliation).
In here, the MC will discover new things as he kept on exploring and trying different stuff. This story will mostly be character-driven. Explanations about the world and its mechanics was kept to a minimum.
The MC's on the shameless side with not much real-life common sense (maybe) and he's (probably) not righteous at all. The other characters can be pretty weird as well.

Release Schedule:  As I wrap up the end of the first major arc, I will publish the chapters as they're completed.  However, as I transition into the next arc, I will go with a two or three times a week release schedule, since I will be splitting time between this story and Chimera.

Every ten years the planet nears its second sun in such a way that the Northern half of the continent warms and thaws and the Araxin enter a period of explosive growth, before always attempting to assault the humans in the South. Through events that you will need to read and discover yourself, sixteen year old Enru ends up vital to the survival of humanity, but can she succeed? In a world full of humans, dragons, giant intelligent spiders, trogs, behemoths lurking in the deep, magic, politics (can’t forget the politics) and more, what wonders await you? 
NOTE: This is my very first attempt at writing ever. Not just my first attempt I am showing people or my first attempt that went anywhere, but my first of any kind. I welcome constructive critisism and I know my grammar is not always the best. If something is majorly bothering you please leave a good comment or review on it rather than just a 0.5 rating and saying I suck. 
NOTE2: The main character will be gaining power that is, if used correctly, well above the standard for her race however I plan to implement it in such a way that she does not end up being crazy over powered and able to end every fight at her whim. She will struggle, she will lose sometimes and there will be loss along her journey to save her race. There will be no harem and I am unsure if there will be any sex scenes or even romance as this is my first story and I am not confident yet at being able to write that properly. So if you came here for the standard royalroad super OP guy that flies around having sex with every female character he meets, this is not that. 
Update Frequency: As this is my first story and I am still in the early stages, I cannot say how often updates will be. I lead a very busy life and this is a new way for me to relieve stress. I hope to be able to put out a few thousand words every few days at the least. 
Enjoy the story!

21307,Apoch's Twilight,"""Reincarnated Into My Half-Finished Isekai VRMMO Tabletop RPG""
Once upon a time, there was a boy named Bull. Bull fancied himself something of a writer and game designer, and had half-created a homebrew roleplaying game for himself and some friends called Apoch’s Twilight. It was a perpetual work-in-progress, as Bull only wrote enough to fill in whatever gaps he needed to run the game for his friends.
Then one day, Bull was hit by a truck. Bull should have looked both ways before crossing the street.
Bull wakes up at a character creation screen, with an AI prompting him to create a character. The name of the game he’s creating a character for?  Apoch’s Twilight.
Say what?

Most BIGs (‘Beyondly’ Immersive Games) have been quashed by Ambrose — the head capital and the center of Liberta’s political power — decades ago for the united territories’ endeavor towards utopia. Tazahari is just a game; not revealing it’s existence and advertising it dubiously as a rehab program is overkill.

So it's not particularly welcome when he's selected by an inscrutable and seemingly omnipotent System as a test subject. The downsides: All of this is insane and by any rational analysis he's gonna die. The upsides: Super powers, a cure for a physical disability that had limited him, and above all, so very much to learn (for as long as he can avoid dying). 
 
I am very much a beginner as an author, and any feedback or suggestions on how to improve would be deeply appreciated. Chapter releases should be daily for the first two weeks and sporadic after that as I use up my buffer. Please consider this work as a rough draft subject to revision and/or retcon.  It is not only my first attempt at original story telling, but at world building and RPG style system design.  The latter has been very difficult, even drawing  on the brilliant work of many RPGs and LitRPGs for inspiration.  Thank you to any willing to give a new story and a new writer a try!","1,830"

21357,Energy,"A discussion of people, monsters, and the nature of reality, all with the scenic backdrop of a litRPG and violent death.
Anthony is your average, unassuming programmer that wakes up from a dream only to find the world he knew is gone, along with much of his memory of it. He is forced to fight for his life (badly) and try to help others (unwillingly) in a desperate bid for not only his own survival, but that of humanity as a whole. 
Join me on my first expedition into writing anything longer than a book report as I ramble endlessly and attempt to cushion the whole thing with exotic adventures in a game world.",759
21358,Soul Construct,"Since the beginning of the world mortals have had souls. Each and every one of them were once made by Phoria, goddess of life, even if they, later on, were twisted, corrupted, uplifted or outright destroyed. Phoria helped each of the other major gods to create their own people with their own souls; Talmaenna made the elves, Kaenig the dwarven people and Metritz got the humans. They each had their own flavour of souls, but it was still the same basic construct.
Aphiir, a minor god of inspiration primarily worshipped by engineers in the dwarven and gnomish communities is doing something new. He's creating his own type of soul - from scratch. Not because he wants his own race or anything but because he wants to see if he can't do it better. He is a god of crafting after all and what is a soul but a very complicated, living, evolving, and unique mana construct? 
***
The story will follow the soul after it's cast onto the mortal plane and as it tries to survive there. I dunno I'm not an experienced writer but I really wanna try and actually write something... longer I guess. I'll try this stuff out during november and hope to have a few chapters out a week depending on the week and how I feel I guess ^^ 
I write pretty slow too so the chapters probably won't be long but I'll try my best to give them some meat at least ^^'",23

Now if only she could find some clothes...

Lyra has always loved listening to the stories of her father's adventures. So when her father  the hero of the Midlands is on the last years of his life.

They live in the village of Delossus, and live an inane life bereft of excitement, but for the stories told by Mrs. Detroit.
One day, a miner wounds up dead in the Taitanus Caves, the place where Wünder's brother works. That incident leads Elysia, Wünder and his brother to an expedition into the depths of a mountain so colossal, that it has terrified villagers and noblemen alike about the possible existence of a certain god residing in its depths.
What they find instead is nothing short of the incarnation of tyranny, and trails leading to a certain legend - the realms long forgotten, not even a remnant of lores... The Elysian Fields.",2

21368,The Dungeon Traveler,"I spent most of my life trying to get by with whatever happiness I could, that included alcohol, food, and porn.My death was unpleasant and humiliating. However, death is something we all need to go through. A bit like a proctology exam; necessary but never anything one wants to go through while it's happening.However, death was supposed to be the end of it. Either way, the pain, suffering, and failures were supposed to be over. I was supposed to wink out, or perhaps take a trip to a lovely afterlife!No, I ended up as a small stone, strapped to a table, while a pimple-faced teenager rubbed my facets and told me how 'lovely' I was. Last time I checked, birth wasn't supposed to be as embarrassing as death!Life as a dungeon core isn't all bad. I like watching lizard love triangles and snooping on militaristic dwarves; though there is that issue where I'm trying to free myself from the entanglements of the Gods....ok, yeah that last one is a bit of a problem.

In the war-torn land of Cyraveil, four heroes strove to overthrow an empire. By cold steel and elemental sorcery, they brought peace to a warring land on the brink of destruction. As the flames died, the realm needed strong leadership, and who better than the champions who had saved the kingdom? But when the people sought out their saviors... they vanished.
Matt, Blake, Jen, and Carl: the four mysterious companions, who together had deposed an insane ruler and saved countless lives, were gone—spirited back in a whirlwind of magic to a sleepy suburb in Mellbridge, Oregon, never to return. The friends found themselves home in the real world, exactly as they'd been the night they were taken, as if no time had passed... except only three came back.
  

 
Hi there! This was my entry for National Novel Writing Month, because why only write one series at a time? The more the merrier! (meanwhile, my keyboard bursts into flames...)
I'm also the writer of The Last Science, an ongoing low-fantasy/speculative sci-fi series. If you're familiar with that, you know what to expect here: lots of character-focused drama and dialogue, not a whole lot of traditional action. However, I'm writing a bit differently than usual here, and in a very different structure, so there should be some surprises for returning readers. I hope you enjoy it!

21375,The Ordinary Life of Tom Nobody,"[participant in the 2018 NaNoWriMo Royal Road challenge]
The Ordinary Life of Tom Nobody is a LitRPG system story where each person transitions into the system, or SCHEMA as this system is known, innocent and unaware of his former life. Following the tutorial, memories return, but by this point, each person has a better chance of accepting their new world. It also gives them an opportunity to start from scratch, fresh without all the baggage of their former lives dictating their decisions in the early stages of the process. I don’t expect this will necessarily turn into an action-packed heroic tale, my intent is to create a character who wants to have just an ordinary, but reasonably comfortable life. I don’t know myself how well he will succeed, there may be twists and Tom may discover some heroism hidden deep inside. I guess we’ll find out together.
This is my first writing attempt. I’ve wanted to write all my life, but I’ve never been able to develop the proper discipline to put in the work. I hope I complete the challenge and work my way past this hump. I am writing this as part of the NaNoWriMo Royal Road Challenge. While I will try to self-edit as I go, the challenge requires close to 2,000 words a day, so parts of the story may be rough, and things like plot lines may not make as much sense as any of us would like. If all goes well, and I complete the challenge, I plan on going back through everything and trying to polish it up. In the meanwhile, thank you for reading and I hope I don’t disappoint.",317
21377,Bright Feather,"I'd like to say something like this is a unique story, blah-blah, but it's not. The story itself is your typical fantasy story with magic, fightings, plot armors, good friends, beautiful ladies and whatever there always is in such stories. I pretty much enjoy typical stories. So I've decided to write one myself. The only thing is the story isn't going to be centered about the Main Character. So let's leave all of the above to him, we'll meet him eventually anyway. This is the story of MC's counterpart. While our greatest Main Character conquers the world, cultivates, and whatever else, what does his destined other half do? Sit and stoically wait for him to come out of the closed door cultivation? Really now...  Just thought it might be interesting to write such a story. Let's see if I manage. I'm new to this so, dear readers, please, don't be harsh on me. But if you have some words for me, so I can improve, don't keep them to yourselves, all help is deeply appreciated. And I officially promise to be very slow and inconsistent with releases (myriads reasons for this.) But I'll still do my best to finish the story someday.  WARNINGS! (I thought a lot, and in the end, I'm putting it here. Better safe than sorry.) First of all, you can probably easily guess, but English is not my native language. And everything that comes with it. I don't think that it excuses me though, so I will improve with time, but warning you nevertheless. Second: No harem, no BL, no Romance And the last but not least: Beware of psychological pressure on characters and characters' deaths. Not much, in my opinion, but still, if you're overly sensitive to violence or mind games, better drop before starting. In any case, you've been warned.  With all the above said, welcome, and enjoy.",7

Some call it Destiny, some call it Providence, others call it The God’s Will. But I call it Fate. My arch-nemesis. Something so invisible, out-of-reach and strong, that no matter how much you fight, there seems no end. But tell me, will you succumb to your fate, as others rise on it. Tell me, will you let your family, your children, your wives be slaughtered and slaved on this so-called Fate.
No.
War.
In a world where lives are nothing more than livestock, either you rise up and rule in passion or go down in flames. Will you stay mum and accept this so-called Fate and be slaughtered by your enemies, or will you rise up. Wealth, fame, fortune, desires are not ever-lasting. Only War is eternal.
Vengeance.
In a world where with no rights and wrong, the weak would be preyed upon while the strong will wreak havoc. But, will you accept your fate of being weak…. No. You rise up and exact revenge for all the wrongs done to you. You rise for Vengeance.
Honor.
Honor… something which runs deep within our blood, but yet forgotten in dust. Something, so intangible, so frail, yet so over-powering. Villains justify it as useless, Lords deem it as unnecessary and Kings mock it as worthless, but yet, it flows ever so deeply within. Deeply… like our thirst of wealth and power. Without this so-called useless, worthless and unnecessary piece of intangible force, we, as Knights are nothing but mere foot soldiers.
So, rise up! Rise Up! RISE UP, my Knights. For War! For Vengeance! For Honor!!!!

It was simply a consequence of a world growing smaller as communication systems became more and more advanced, partly a result of said visitations. For the most part, past interactions between one of the planet Earth's more intelligent species of lifeform and the alien visitors were along the lines of obscure scientific surveys and tests disturbingly similar to attempts by some human scientists to estimate the intelligence of simians. For any species capable of travelling the stars. Visiting planet Earth made about as much sense as backpacking through the Ural Mountains of Siberia with nothing but a flint and a compass. That is to say, most people would prefer to stay close to someplace within walking distance of a mall or a population density slightly higher than four sapient beings per parsec. Still, statistically speaking, there are bound to be some weirdos who find joy rides though a nowhere solar system fun.

21422,Limit Experience,"A Limit Experience is a type of action or experience which approaches the edge of living in terms of its intensity and its seeming impossibility.
It is to revel in the paradoxical nature of madness or maddening circumstance. To receive the greatest of ecstasy from insufferable pain. To seek enlightenment through ascetic starvation. To gain strength from self-destruction. This strip between the transcendental and reality where the mad lay and adventure blooms are endemic to human nature despite its terrifying consequences. It is a disease that we seek out for the sake of living a life worth dying for. This story shall have some snippets of philosophy in regards to mysticism and phenomenology.
Here I try to create a dichotomy to the mediocre life most live where dreams die in the graveyard due to the very possibility of success bringing about paralyzing fear. Fantasy seems to be a fine place to hyperbolize what is to be seen. This will be a descent into madness and road to perhaps more redemptive experience.
This story will be brutal, focusing on both introspective and explicit actions taken by the main heroine with room to branch into side characters both friend and enemy. This story will start in our reality briefly and then transfer to a world of fantasy and magic via reincarnation.

I originally had this as part of the prologue, then I realized that it made a better synopsis.
Please note: this might seem a bit clunky because I haven't done a lot of writing, and this is supposed to be a kind of prequel to another story that I plan on doing in the future. I will not be fully explaining everything but instead will be explaining things in that other story. This is mainly to help fill in the lore of the world so that people will have at least a basic idea of how things function. Regardless of that, that story won't be written for at least another year, so deal with it.
Note: I am using ideas from several different authors in order to make sure that this can be a proper story. You may or may not recognize where I got them. I am not writing a Fanfiction and do not claim these as my own. I will add to a list of titles below as I find myself using those ideas.

21441,Alterlife,"ALTERLIFE is in the vein of BREAKING BAD and READY PLAYER ONE. 
Warning: ALTERLIFE is dark in nature. It contains graphic language, violence, and drug use, and is intended for a mature audience. 
A man's quest for freedom. A world of limitless possibilities. 
Down on his luck and with his back against a wall, John Crussel would do anything to provide for his family. Even rob a bank out of desperation. But when he hears of how he can make money in a virtual reality video game called Alterlife, he walks away from the robbery and decides to give it a shot. 
Couldn't be harder than robbing a bank, could it? 
John's world is about to change as he finds that Alterlife is easier than it seems. But being a hotshot new guy that seems to have all the luck draws the attention of some dangerous people in Alterlife - ones that want what he has and are willing to do anything for it.
As the line between the real world and the virtual world begins to blur,  John begins to question his sanity. He soon finds himself in a fight for his life and is forced to make a difficult choice, one that will change his future and shake the very foundation of everything he knows.
The game setting of this book is modeled after the early MMO's and is likened to Ultima Online and Everquest. Readers can expect to find character progression in the game, quests, and items with various degrees of power and abilities. ALTERLIFE is not 'crunchy' with statistics.

As humans navigate the unfamiliar terrain, their primary concern becomes survival. This all-consuming drive, born out of their deep-rooted instincts, gives rise to whispers that spread like wildfire among the natives. Tales of humans resorting to cannibalism in the direst of circumstances send a chill down the spines of those who hear them. The mere suggestion of humans feasting upon the flesh of elves or dwarves elicits both terror and fascination.
The natives also observe a harrowing aspect of human behavior when faced with impending doom. In their final moments, a savage and frenzied light dances within the humans' eyes. Fueled by an indomitable will to survive, they unleash a ferocity that defies reason, determined to take as many adversaries down with them as possible. This glimpse into the depths of human desperation leaves a lasting impression on those who witness it, forever imprinting the idea that humans possess an untamed and unpredictable nature.
Amidst the rumors and unsettling observations, the interactions between humans and the native species become a delicate dance of caution, curiosity, and, at times, cooperation. The realms of trust and understanding are tested as the true intentions of both sides gradually unfold.
Within this tapestry of fear and fascination, a deeper truth begins to emerge. The humans' extraordinary adaptations to the magical forces of the world carry the weight of ancient prophecies. Their arrival is not a mere coincidence but a part of a larger cosmic design.

 My current plans for this story are NOT to create an OP character that can kill anything they want. I do want to create a reasonable character that has flaws and goes on an adventure of both wonder and self-realization. 



 
Prologue
GRN 55323, that’s my name. Given to me by my creators five years ago. I was created to work on, fix, and improve the Sleep Infinium. The Sleep Infinium is a dream augmenting software chip that changes what you dream about when you sleep. You may be thinking that I'm a robot based on the fact that I said I was created but that is just how people are made in the current time. People are very rarely born anymore to be born is reserved for high-class individuals that have more money. I was created by my employer and now I work and slave away every day and get paid almost nothing to do so. Now don't go thinking I have a Shitty life because I was happy when I was created as I knew of nothing different. This was it and I was content with living life as a slave it was how I was trained.
Of course, that didn't last for me. My happy life ended the day a customer told me that they didn't want their broken Sleep Infinium returned because they had already bought a new one. I had told the customer that I had already fixed their chip and would still need the payment because the work had been done to which I was promptly chewed out and told that if I didn't cancel the charge then they would report me to the IWB (Improper Workforce Bureau) which will have me fired. I had heard about this kind of thing happening before. The guy who had my job before me had been fired by the IWB and when a created individual is fired from their job that they are literally made to do they are turned into manual labor slaves. Which at the time was the worst thing I could imagine.
So, of course, I apologized profusely begging them not to report me and that I would not charge them and call it a misunderstanding. I thought that would be the end of it but I now had a Sleep Infinium chip that had no registered owner and no way of being returned to the company because it would alert them of my mistake and would result in me getting fired. So I kept it hidden at my place of residence. I have a room in the basement of my office where I keep all my personal belongings. It's not much but I was happy with it as a slave employee I couldn’t have asked for a better life.
I had information on how the Sleep Infinium worked and how to fix it while also make it run better. But I really didn't know about what happened when you put it into your chip port. My curiosity was what ended up being my undoing. After a few months of wrestling with myself over whether or not I should plug in the chip, I finally decided that I would try it once and then be done with it. So when I got off work on Sunday I ran to my room and plugged the chip into my chip port. But nothing happened I expected a menu to come up in front of my eyes asking me or telling me things like back in the academy.

Millie is the eldest child of the Augustine family, a noble family in the Kingdom of Saxony. Although being a woman she was barred from succeeding her father as head of the family. In addition, she has been treated rather poorly by most of her family due to her tomboyish personality. But one day as a youth, she met someone in the woods behind her house, and this encounter would forever change her fate.

21519,The Female Perspective,"Aidan’s game review YouTube channel and affiliated blog were never going to be the biggest things on the Internet, but if you were a fan of MMORG or RPG gaming, you’d certainly have heard of it. His combination of knowledge of gameplay, the lore and (sort of) the technology behind it were nothing special. But the snark he brought to the table? That had won him a following. Not enough of a following for him to ever quit his job at the customer service desk of a payroll processing firm, but, eh, everybody needs a hobby.
And, oh, how these reviews irritated Game Devs. Elana Bancroft in particular. But astute business woman she was, she knew she needed his input for her next project, a revolutionary immersive MMORG, codenamed Wellspring, supervised and chaperoned by an AI developed by her father, the neuroscientist Peter Bancroft. She’d learn a few things. Oh, and definitely teach the guy a few. And daddy’s Data Algorithhm Virtual Immersive System (DAVIS) would help her. And while she was at it, her best friend Maribel. Sweet girl, but boy did she need some steel in her spine.
Everything was going swimmingly. Until DAVIS decided to get a few ideas of its own.
This work is likely best categorized as GameLit, with elements of LitRPG and traditional High Fantasy. Sexual content will exist by reference, but I plan on writing nothing explicit. Virtual genderbending will likely be the most risque element. Violence and virtual death will also obviously be involved in this work, but at no point should this element rise to the graphic or the gruesome. I hope to tell a reasonably believable story with humorous elements that an intelligent thirteen year old could enjoy. And that a parent could let them read with few misgivings.
The Female Perspective is being written as my entry for NaNoWriMo 2018. I can offer no guarantees as to when or how often update chapters will be posted; in fact do not be surprised if a week of silence is followed by a flurry of activity. And as a NaNoWriMo entry, please note that niceties of grammar, spelling and plot may at times be sacrificed on the Altar of Expedience, as in getting to fifty thousand words by November 30. I intend to post this work on both Wattpad and Royal Road and see what I see.
Finally, given that my knowledge of photoshop and affiliated products is close to nil, if anyone is interested in creating a cover for this work and I am more than willing to look it over, and if I decide to use it, to give credit for said cover here. In the unlikely event I were I going to commission a cover it would be Aidan, Elana, Maribel, Brian and Wolfgang standing next to each other staring into a pool of water, with Svanura, Brandagas, The Oracle, Volvara, and Balan reflected back. Not useful to any budding artist as a reference until the work is complete, but there you have it.
Needless to say, this work should be considered a DRAFT as it is posted.",14

All and all, it's a twist on the common super-hero world, where all super-heroes have somehow dissappeared, but not the possibility for new ones. The series that feature the mushroom-dude are the 123 ones, the stories that feature Smith are the ABC ones, and the ones that feature our newest character, the summoner-dude, are the abc ones. Neat, huh?
Also, just a word of warning? The 123 ones are kind wierd, and you can skip the first few chapters and go straight to the ABC ones without missing too much. But I'd rather you didn't, since i really enjoyed writing them. In ABC and abc, the format changes to a more typical form, with proper grammar and stuff. So if you dont like the 123, I'd love it if you gave the ABC a chance :^)
Anyhow, I hope you enjoy it!",4

~Title --> Based off Vitiate's Speech.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A/N: First things, first, I would like to apologise. I made a terrible story, then an arguably even worse remake. Then, I quit Royal Road. So... Sorry? Uhh... Notes, below!
Yes, this is a sequel to an incomplete novel/fanfiction. One which I tried to do a remake of, but failed, not even in the spectacular way, as well... Anyway, it's been quite some time, and I stopped using Royal Road, due to the failure that the prequel of this was. (Stopped writing, cause I was so bad, :D)
Dabbled in a One Piece Fan-Fiction for a bit (and still do), which went better than this did. Also, in hindsight, 1000 words isn't long enough for a chapter. I do about now (excluding the first chapter/prologue/notes) about 3000-5000 words per chapter. Which is a good thing for this one, I guess?
I improved quite a bit, as well. Think of it as like a time skip. Not like the One Piece time skip, no, I didn't improve that much. More like the Naruto time skip, where Naruto came back from training with Jiraiya. 
Back to the point, this is a sequel which takes place four years after what I was going to write about at the end of the Corellia Planetary Arc. As I mentioned in the notes of ""Eregis, Descent (I) Corellia"", the Corellia Planetary Arc ending, would be very different, as it was the last Arc for the Volume.
I won't tell you what was meant to happen, as that would spoil it. 
Well, that's the end of the Synopsis. 
Final Note: This story will be taking a much more serious tone. Because, to be honest, my old story, didn't need the Content Warning Tags, except for Profanity. There will be somewhat detailed deaths, the same amount of profanity (Star Wars Profanity is weird), and as much sexual content, that I can create. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary: Following the events of Corellia, Shaange finds himself awaking from a four year slumber to a familiar and different Galaxy. People have changed, though not for the worse, not necessarily for the better either.

Updates: Every 1-2 weeks.

Content Warning: Profanity, Gore, Sexual Content.
Also contains mild Homosexuality. (Both Male and Female)

The rapid influx of magic something life had ill prepared them for. On the heel of that same tide came an interface. Different for every being, the interface was a tool to organize the chaos wrought by the newfound burgeoning power that swept the universe.

A women who begins her journey in this new world approximately 3.2 million years late. Join her as she awakes in this new world confused and alone. Will she survive? Will she ever discover that the world she lived in was 3.2 million years ago? Not much of that world remains after all, and this new one is dangerous indeed.

This is my first time writing, and to tell you the truth I'll probably be kinda dense with alot of the stuff, so don't hesitate to throw some smack downs. I'm hoping that will let me learn faster.

First story I'm posting and I don't really have a cool synopsis, sorry everyone, but this story is just another LitRPG apocalypse. I guess the only difference is that the main character isn't a hero. He's not here to save the world, he's not here to make friends, and he's definitely not here to save everyone. He's probably what the villains in other similar stories would be actually. Just writing for fun, advice or constructive critism is welcomed, writing style prone to change.
Warning: Incredible amounts of poor grammar, Gore, Profanities, Traumatizing content, and cliches(I plan to have multiple main characters, maybe this is too ambitious for my poor skills, but it seems like it would be fun to try, the other MCs won't show up until later on.)
The cover image isn't mine I just found it online. It's a piece by Stephanie Frey
This takes inspiration from a lot of great stories on here, but I find the beginning to be most similar to Blood Lust by DefinitelyNotJormlung. Starcraft and Warhammer 40k and survival world rpg by S_Conary will also influenced this (at least that's my plan if I ever get that far or finish this) Also please stay with me until chapter 3. I suck at starting stories, but have been told I get better as I'm further along.",27

Just my take on how an RPG in the DBZ universe would play out if you were thrust into it.
Some heavy themes, tragedy and domestic abuse.
Lots of tropes, both Japanese and Chinese.
New at writing so constructive criticism and suggestions are very welcome. Grammar fixes are also welcome.

21623,The Perks of Immortality,"This story will no longer be updated.

Now, Kegan has the ability to gain “perks” that can make his life much easier. He is looking forward to finally having an easy life with the new perks he has earned.

Rules to keep me honest for the perk system:

Spoiler: Spoiler


1. The purpose of perks is to help the MC live longer and do new things each life.
2. The perks can be unlocked by getting hurt or killed.
3. The perks can be unlocked by putting in a lot of effort that isn’t easily duplicated in a new life.
4. Perks are generally beneficial enhancements to the MC’s body.
5. Perk costs can be lowered with more impressive achievements to unlock them.
6. Perk costs can be lowered by repeated death or injury from something the perk protects against.
7. Perk costs are increased for quality of life improvements that don’t benefit survival.



I want to avoid one of the pitfalls I see for other LitRPG stories where the game elements barely relate to the story, or offer very little information. If people are skipping over and not reading the perks then I'm doing things wrong. So I promise to try and make the perks interesting, sometimes humorous, informative, and relevant to the story.Cover art by http://dertypaws.com/","3,790"

Alan looked up through the crack in the wooden wall at a hazy sky. The morning sun was just peeking out over the horizon, lighting a world in which there was no longer balance. He watched thin wisps of clouds swirling in the breeze above his small town. The gentle mists moved with no intention, flowing in sweeping circles creating a thin veil yet to be burnt off by the red morning light.
Taking a deep shaking breath, Alan shifted his gaze down towards the corpses of everyone he had known. His heart beat faster as his eyes adjusted, the red light above meeting the bloody red scene below.
Was he the only one left alive?

21836,The Pirates from the Forgotten Isle,"“All hands on deck!” The Captain’s voice rang through the dark air. Henry stumbled to the deck, rubbing his eyes sleepily. Behind him, Tanner and Elizabeth both scrambled up the stairs, guns raised at the terrified voice of the captain. Rain poured down onto their faces and the sails jerked this way and that, throwing a few sailors from the deck.
         “Man over board!” Tanner yelped as he attempted to calm the sails. The Captain stood at the helm, shouting orders and ducking the debris that flew over her head. Her blonde hair dripped with seawater and her cutlass was stuck into the wood of the deck, holding her in place.
         Henry was confused, what was happening? Elizabeth cried out as a barrel was uprooted from its holder and rolled towards them. They both dove out of the way and watched slowly as the barrel moved over the opening of the door that led to their quarters, blocking the exit for the other sailors. Henry pulled himself to his feet, but was slammed to the floor again by a loose flying board.
         “The ship is falling apart!” Elizabeth yelled.
“Thank you for that helpful note Elizabeth, we were all really confused!” The Captain returned as she ran to the barrel, attempting to free her sailors. Henry and Tanner both ran to help her, but the barrel was too heavy and the ship was slowly beginning to overturn. Then Henry looked up; an ominous wave was growing over their heads. The remaining sailors jumped overboard, attempting to save their lives but perishing as soon as they sank beneath the waves. The Captain jerked open the door to her cabin that was only a few feet away and pulled Henry, Tanner and Elizabeth into it.
“Hold on.” She murmured, and those were the last words Henry heard before the ship overturned and water threw him out a window and into the open sea.

Henry’s eyes opened to the bright, afternoon sun. For a moment, he had forgotten the events from last night. But then the memories and scenes flooded back into his brain and he groaned. He spat sand from his mouth and stretched his arms as he sat up and looked around. Wood boards, wheat sacks and some spoons were all that remained of the ship on the beach. Many sailors lay around him, but he was uncertain for their lives. Slowly he stood and stepped over the bodies of his fellow sailors. He knelt beside Tanner quietly and watched his chest, trying to see if he was ok. Henry slapped his face and waited for a reaction. A moment passed without reaction, then Tanner coughed and sat up. Henry breathed a sigh of relief before fondly patting his friend’s back, straightening up and moving towards Elizabeth, who was only a few feet away. But as he started to kneel beside her, she stuck out her hand and stopped him. “Don’t touch me. Don’t rush me. Don’t talk to me. I will get up when I want to.” She growled. A few moments passed before she stood up, then the three survivors slowly walked to the edge of the beach and quietly watched the sunset over the waves.
“Where’s our captain?” Tanner finally asked. The question seemed to linger in the air before vanishing and the sailors turned, convinced of the fate of their captain.",3

Author's Comment:
It's here, a rewrite? Yes! I would like to think that this version will have better grammar, better jokes, hopefully, everything better. Since it was my first work and started solely to improve my English, the grammar always caused me headaches when I looked at it.
Well, and there are the plotholes which appeared with the whole multiverse thing that came with my other works... Let's just say that the first one was never written with the idea of turning it into a series.
So let's get a shovel and fill-up the plot so that hapless readers won't fall into those pitch-black pits. They might break a knee! Or worse, vanish forever. 
And now the disclaimer everyone knows:
I was asked about reading my work on other sites. The answer is simple: Currently, I am not active in any other networks than royalroadl.com. Only here, I correct mistakes and errors. If you read it anywhere else and have to pay for it or have to deal with an annoying amount of advertisement, You Are Being Betrayed. You would do good if you make other people in that network aware of it. This is a free project of mine for the purpose of having fun. And if people try to make money with it you shouldn't bother visiting their website.

She's just here to have fun.
Book Six - Lost to Faith

21872,The Burning,"In every war, there is an enemy. In this war he was born as the enemy.
Bowen lives day to day. Usually fighting in the betting arena or pickpocketing those around him to put food on the table so he doesn’t starve. Viewed as the lowest due to the gloves he wears to hide the Insignia he gained during his Burning ceremony. People think he is likely a Crafter who failed to get access to his trade or a worthless Unskilled. When its revealed he is neither, he is pushed into a life he feared.",11
21873,King of the continent!,"The world named Kòs (written in Dark Theme)
(kòsmos means world in greek) (maybe i´m going to change the name of the planet)
Kòs is a world so vast that you can´t even imagine its true size. Magic exists there and changed the live of its inhabitants drastically. With the flow of time it began to change even more.
A species which were called humans emerged and with time they created cities, countries, empires. They quickly fought wars with each other. Some of these were so cruel that even the GOD of SLAUGHTER and CARNAGE was pleased.
This story plays on a few of the many continents that exist on the surface of the planet and tells you about a man that became the undisputed overlord of his home continent. (King, Emperor, nobody knows what he should be called, God maybe?)",2
21874,Elements of Reality,"Sages. when one looks up the term in the dictionary, ignoring the plant variation, it means:
A profoundly wise man.
That, is not what it means to most people in this story.
A Sage is a being beyond other humans, capable of moving the elements of the world to his will, and able to do impressive feats of strength.
Kazuya Hiiro is a Sage, one of many in the world, born with the power to control elements, said power unlocked at the age of twelve.
The only issue was... there were only ten elements right?
So why did he have an eleventh?

21875,Theomachy,"Jake Thomas is an ordinary kid in his eyes. Others think he's talented, and they'd be right.
An excellent skater, a poet who enjoys the works of shakespeare, capable of learning nearly any instrument he touches, top marks in Biology and Chemistry with regards to medicine, and a practical savant with a bow and arrow.
This is all explained by a simple fact: Jake Thomas is not human, but a Demigod son of Apollo.
But that's fine, because Aegis, the organization of Demigods who aim to protect all of humanity from supernatural threats, is willing to take him on and put him through school...
He does fear for his life though, knowing that the enemies Aegis commonly faces aren't simple things like werewolves or vampires...
No, Aegis fights Gods.

For some, death is not the end but only the beginning.
These unlucky few are forced to call the endless abyss, a space between time and dimensions, home as they infiltrate the physical plains to gain substance and strength.
Here we find the self-named Nyx, a being that has recently gained his freedom from a tyrannical summoner in a cultivation based world.
Free at last, Nyx is more than content to reside in the void for the rest of his existence.
However, it seems fate doesn't agree, and Nyx soon finds himself back inside a mortal body.
Yet, much to Nyx's delight, it seems those that have summoned him this time have done so in ignorance.

Technically humans don't need to breathe. If no one had any more children everyone would be dead in the next one hundred fifty years probably. Does this count as a synopsis? No? Okay.

Cause his old world had magic and all. I don't want to give anything away. I swear this fiction is more serious than I am I just find it hard to write a synopsis.

21887,Corinth,"This is the story of an expanding empire, not understanding its reach, unfulfilled by its goals, and misled by its gods. It follows a group of travellers as they try to expand the empire, and probe the edges of its control. It is set in a world in which power is directly connected to origins, ancestry, and the gods of a culture. It examines the effects of conflict on a people when they can’t be disconnected from their surroundings, and thus true mobility is not possible.
The first book will be focusing on a group trying to explore and settle the lands east of their empire. Deciding that a new push is needed, groups are being funded to take and farm the near-empty land, and this group of four is heading out ahead of many of the settlers.

https://www.royalroad.com/amazon/B07MYJ5ZRC
  
 
“You will die!” 
That's what the developers of Blood Seekers promised them...
The most challenging MMO ever created—that’s how they advertised it. Taglines like, “Not your granddaddy’s game,” and, “Only for the hardest of the hardcore,” had gamers going crazy. Set in a gothic, Lovecraftian world, with fully realized A.I. NPCS, gamers were desperate to get their hands on the new game and dive in, and Clay was one of them. It was going to be tough, but he was ready for it.
What he wasn’t ready for, was countless players having their minds hijacked and being transformed into mindless, hostile creatures filled with nothing but hate who killed anyone on sight. They called them the Bloodless.
Clay’s best and only friend, Rey, moved across the country she was twelve, but they kept in touch online, playing countless games together, and when Blood Seekers was released, they were both ready to step up to the plate and face the new challenge together. But now, Rey has been taken by the plague, her mind held hostage as one of the Bloodless.
A mysterious black monolith has appeared at the center of the highest level zone in the game, a place no one has even come close to. Some say it will provide us with answers. Others say it will only lead to more questions.
Who’s behind all this? Why are people’s minds being taken? Will we ever get to bring them back? How many more will be lost if we stay logged in?
Nothing is certain, but if there’s any chance that reaching the monolith will bring Rey back back, then Clay will do everything he can to reach it.
This is Book 1 in a new series from Stephen Roark! I will be posting chapters here until the book is done and published on Amazon!",93
21895,In the Name of God,"It is the year 2124 and the world has changed. Natural disasters and wars, but also advancements in sciences and arts. Still, even though things change, their core aspects are often the same. Entertainment is no exception.
A good example would be Project Revelations by DEM Entertainment, the RPG to end all other RPGs. Using the most advanced technology available to man, Full Immersion Sarcophagus, PR isn't simply another game but a whole new world—one with its own races, cultures, languages, and religions. A whole new world to explore.
They have decided to remind everyone what 'RP' in 'RPG' stands for, making it clear their greatest focus was on players' ability to roleplay their characters, whatever they may be. And people love them.
Dariusz Zargar, Commonwealth's resident of Iranian descent, is one such person. With love for RPGs and any roleplays fostered by both of his parents, he couldn't stay idle, awaiting the moment of PR's release. But when it turned out one of the possible methods of character's creation was whatever the player imagined, not bound by the rules of this new world…
“And I do mean anything. As long as both Grand Director and I deem it interesting enough, it’s fair play. So, go wild.”
How could he resist that? And if everything is possible, why not make his ancestors proud? It certainly would be unique.
…although, in hindsight making his character a follower of an ancient Iranian religion maybe, just maybe, wasn't his brightest idea.

First Web Novel ever, yay.
So, what can you expect from this work? Well, worldbuilding for one. That includes races, history, languages, religion etc. etc. often based on/inspired by some of the more obscure mythologies/cultures, most notably Zoroastrianism and Slavs though not only.
As far as Characterization goes, I'll try to keep it real. So no romance unless it makes sense, harems are almost certainly not a possibility because of how difficult it is to write a good one etc. Also, don't expect MC to suddenly start killing everyone and feel completely unaffected after; that's not how any of this work. Does it really matter it's a game if everything feels so real?",14
21897,Before I Go Insane,"Centuries have passed through medieval age.

        Fans of Horror and Litrpg will want to look at what it is really like to be trapped in a game, where everything and everyone is plotting to kill you.  Who can you trust?  Who can you call?  Who Will save you?  These are the things that plague Ramzan's thoughts as he struggles to survive just one more second in the Nightmare Game.",57
21930,Ashes of the Arctic,"It's Alaska.  Mid-March, 2019.  The shit just hit the fan.  The Mat-Su Valley was the first to go down, but it's quickly becoming clear that all of Earth is screwed.  There might be other survivors, but Envy, Rusty, Douglass, and Mandy are just fighting to survive each new hellish day...",117
21931,The Last Immortal,"My name is Arthur and I am dying.I am the last of my kind as I slew the restTo some I am the greatest hero to walk the earth, To others, I am the Devil made manifest. Some call my race The Immortals, Some call my race The Scourge. I walked the earth during Ragnarok. I have burned worlds, destroyed continents, and slew gods. I am the last of my kind. Will you listen to this old man's tale?
This story is a litrpg/ summoned hero. We all know the tales about the hero triumphing over evil, about the story of the hero saving the world, but what happens if there is no great hero if no one saves the day, what happens if after Ragnarok is completed and the world is over, what happens to those left behind.
It is a tale of loss and growth pain and happiness, sadness and joy. About a broken man learning to live again.

Overseen is set in an earth ruled by an AAI (Advanced Artifically Intelligent) bot known as Eon, who cares nothing for humans aside from ruling them with total control. Those who submit to him are then put through an excruciating process which wipes their memory, replaces many limbs and muscles with cybernetics, includes a chip to control  the mind, and includes a self destruct sequence which will cause them to die nearly instantly if their chip is ever removed. Those who fight back against Eon die, or are taken prisoner, and yet again made Overseen. Yet, against all odds, Trevor, a teenage former Overseen, finds himself brainwashed in a scrapyard not far from a battlefield full of smoldering corpses and destroyed bots. He records his tale in his log which resides in his mind virtually, allowing him to write without any sort of computer or writing tool, and soon finds himself on an epic adventure, meeting friends, (and enemies-- mainly enemies) escaping from and destroying bots, and making his way to the faction known as the Accusers, a force bent on saving humanity.",0

The first man of great might. Who hunted the monster and saw them as know more than a means to an end. He fought to simply feed his hungry for blood and power. He challenged both the heavens and the darkest depths of hell. He made the world know meaning of the word fear. He was a strongest swordsman of the world. During his time their were few who could say otherwise and by his end their was know to be only one who claimed to be his better. There were none who love the sword like him. And there would be none who his blade would love like him. They said that number did not matter to him. That all who face him blade would die without exception. They is a legend of him bringing death to an empire so he could claim the life of widow of a soldier who died of his own blade in the face death so that the sword man would not now the satisfactory of taking his life. They called him the sword of death.
 
The second was a man of great rage. An noble avenger to the weak and and terror to the strong. He was a berserker but unlike most who would attempt to control they rage he would reveal in the through of it controlling him. He would streak across the battlefield ripping both friend and foe apart alike and he would do so with nothing but his bare hand. They called him an immortal they said the more be bleed the more his power would grow. And they spoke of the power to he he could trade his blood for death. They said that no mortal weapon could kill him and that he would rise to fight no matter the injury. There was a legend of him ripping off his own head and using it to club his enemies to death. They called him the immortal wrath.
 
The third was a woman of madness and magic. She was a hated witch. They say that her only objects was to spread misery and hate. It said she lead many a good man from the right path to one of great evil just to she if she was capable of such things. Her experiments left only detestation in their wake as she tainted the lands in some way worse than the worse then the void or darkness ever could. Her magic was a foul and dangerous thing that saw all her enemy become her enemy. That she enter the territory of both the formed of order and the gods of Chao us would not go. That she played with the energy of the void. Legend speaks of a place where she corrupted the very darkness that that claim both the land and the people. Some say light would flee from her presence in fear of the shadows fate for that was her name she was the fate weaver. 
 
The forth was a man. He was simply known as… the hero of the world.

No this is a story that speak of the other three
The unrelenting swords man
The undying wrath 
The unquantifiable desire
But it mainly speaks of their second life. For the age of darkness has long since pases and the age of fire is coming to a close. But as the age dies a new one must be born.

21941,Image Conqueror,"Before you read this, despite how the first chapter seems, this is a fantasy reincarnation novel. It is not a story about technological developments.
I will edit this synopsis, it is frankly terrible:
Life in a new world. A world different from the old world. A world where magic rules above all other things. A world where everyone can drive magic, can use the power of magic. A world where the only thing that limited your power was your ability to imagine, your ability to manifest your memories into a mental picture. The clearer the image in your mind, the more focused the magic, the more vivid the image, the more powerful the magic.
 
Old Synopsis:
Life in a new world. A world where magic rules above all. A world where everyone has the power to do magic. A world where the only thing that commanded magic was your memories. The ability to imagine them. The clearer the image, the more focused the magic. The more vivid the image, the more powerful the magic.
However, what if you were blind? There was magic that could fix blindness, but they could not control magic with the images made from magic. Even though new images could be formed with the eyes healed by magic, these images could not be used to invoke the world's law of magic.
Only one in all of history has broken this rule...

I'm very greatful for everything my parents did for me and for the dreams that let me see there faces again. Never letting me forget why i do the things i do.

Confused at first, they soon realize all their levels, stats and skills have been reset to those of a new character's. Strangely enough their inventory remained untouched and all legendary equipment have thus been preserved, but none of that mattered as being level 1 meant they could not overcome the level requirements to adorn them.
What was going?
As they continued forward they quickly find out that perhaps things were not the same as the game they remembered, or rather, it was exactly the same but 'different' in a way. Things have become more 'real', as if this was no longer just a game but reality. If that was the case, then even after the reset they still had one advantage on their side: they knew the game's story. Using that knowledge they will have to live on in this familiar yet dangerous new world.

21989,Visions of Nol,"Nol, a galaxy brimming with power and advanced technology, home to a host of unique races. As the galaxy enters another era of peace, turmoil beneath the surface may bring unexpected changes. This is the story of Nol. The galaxy, its people, civilizations, and events that shape and intertwine destinies. Follow stories of legends, of turmoil and salvation, of the mighty and the meek. No tale is too small to be told, as all, from planet breaking battles to the simple struggles of daily life, are Nol.
# # #
The Visions of Nol are short stories that depict the Nol Galaxy from a variety of angles. Through these stories, I hope to show a wholistic image of Nol. Each story will follow a new character, or will take place on a different planet, show different lifestyles, aliens, and tell different stories of individuals in Nol. If you get attached to a character, don't worry, because they'll probably pop up again somewhere in this web of interconnected stories.  In the visions of the Nol Galaxy, no story is too small to be told.

Each life is supposed to be a learning process for your soul to make amends to fight for what you believe in. Some souls are tainted and they continue to taint themselves and the others around, so too does the opposite happen. Kindred souls are drawn together and they can bring calamity or salvation to their respective worlds. But what does this have to do with the story well, our friend Alexander is reborn into a world of magic but of course that’s not enough to mention him, no the true reason we will follow his story is because much like there are those who claim to remember their past life, he truly does have a head start in his case.
Author's Note: Thanks for taking your time to read my first try at writing. English is my first language, so please correct me on anything that sounds wrong.

With all titles and infamy passed on to them, the group has only regarded themselves as simple wanderers. Each searching for their own meaning, this is their story on how they fought, lived, and met.
 
Fair warning: This story is my take and a jab on the typical isekai/tensei trope with demon lords, heroes, and cataclysmic fate of the world rest in the hands of the saviors and some rpg game elements. If you are tired of these kind of tropes then feel free to skip this story, if not then I hope you enjoy my story.",9

22009,So What If I'm Trash? Who Needs Cultivation?!,"Qing Shan Long. They say he isn't human. An escaped experiment from some government facility, a reincarnation of a saint, a freakish superhuman. Whatever he was one thing was clear. Be it Music, Martial Arts, Science, whatever he does he excels. He was a whimsical man. A great man. A man who craving for knowledge and excitement knows no bounds, whose collection of books and personal library would even make Alexander the Great green with envy. He donated to all manners of charities and funded many projects for helping the poor and disabled.
A self made man who single handedly founded one of the largest corporations in the world, Wen Qu Technologies, whose influences reach from vast fields of expertise. From objects of war such as the newest aircrafts, droids, and body armor; to life saving medicine and vaccines; to even the mundane such as video games and the fast food industry. A legendary example of determination and hard work. He was in his car being driven to a business meeting to disclose a deal that would help ensure the country could have access to clean energy and help reduce the pollution that has been plaguing his homeland for the past millenia when he was assassinated and woke up in a strange new world. How will Qing Shan deal with his new environment where the strong suppresses the weak? From the top of the world he suddenly finds himself free falling to rock bottom. Unable to cultivate, a weak body, and all but disowned by his family.
 
(For those who read comics and watch cartoons, imagine him as being Tony Stark, Richard Reeds, Jimmy Neutron, etc level of 'Genius'. )
 
My own spin on some familar tropes. Another reincarnation into another world story. The MC will take over the body of someone with a trash body that can't cultivate and will be hated and neglected by his family. Pretty typical so far right? Except there won't be some amazing miracle to heal our MC, there isn't some magical grandpa to teach him some OP thing which only his trash body can use, there isn't a hidden op bloodline, and he is not from a super amazing assassin clan or genius doctor. He isn't the chosen one, he's just a guy trying his best to make something with a crap situation. First attempt at a wuxia type story!
I like playing with common tropes, maybe adding a twist, to playing it straight as a classic. I have absolutely no idea where this is going to take me but please do give your input and I'll do my best so that everyone has a say in where our journey will go.
I'll admit the only knowledge I have of chinese history and ancient society is from reading light novels translated to english and some old dramas, so if I make some social passe just take it as because this is another world, not exactly an AU where magic and stuff actually exist. I'm also not actually Chinese and will basically using google to help me with names and other such, if I make a mistake please let me know!

22010,Trailblazer,"The story of a man who accidentally wrote another world into existence.
Everyone breaks away from their mundane daily life in one way or another. Our protagonist, an unfortunate consequence of circumstance, being no different, often escaped the harsh reality of life by writing stories of an alternate world of swords and magic. Though he recognized the difference between reality and fantasy, he could've never imagined what would happen, when the line between the two blurred as lightning struck down from the skies, and his escapism fantasy became all too real...
After he came to, he would soon learn that things in the other world aren't quite as he remembered them to be. The world he wrote of had become but a shadow of its former self.
Albeit hesitant at first, he sets off on a quest to find out the secrets behind the Trails, yet even then, he can't help but wonder... Can he really bring his world back to its old glory?

22103,Ætla Verǫld,"AV Online was just a flash in the pan—a harsh, experimental land which lost most of its players in mere weeks. Only the dedicated few remained, carving out their destinies in corners of the vast abandoned world. 
Lily Quinn wasn't one of them. With a career worth millions in the esports world, she didn't have time for a game like Avo—but when an exclusive beta test for the new version showed up on her doorstep, she couldn't say no… as much as she wanted to. Literally hooked into the simulation, Lily reluctantly entered a world beyond anything she'd ever dreamed of. 
Accompanied by seven other beta testers desperate to save their beloved game, Lily dives into a vibrant, beautiful world, where mystery and adventure waits around every corner. Despite her reservations, Lily finds a joyful escape in Avo, shattering her cold, hollow reality. It was just a game though… until the group discovered they couldn't log out. Trapped in a game with no rules, and surrounded by cutthroat players eager to kill for a quick windfall, Lily and her ragged band have no choice but to fight their way out, or die in a game that has turned all too real.
 

 
Hi there! I'm setting off on yet another adventure, come join me :3
Unusually for me, there's only one perspective this time, and it's quite a bit more action-oriented than I usually write. Don't worry, though: everything's still as character-driven as always, and I never get tired of writing dialogue. Just to acknowledge it up front: this story is heavily inspired by EVE Online and the many stories generated by that world. However, since this is a fantasy setting, not sci-fi, don't expect any real parallels. 
Chapter publish rate for this one will be whenever I write them, as with Epilogue. I don't expect to move as fast here though, since it's not for NaNo. The plan is chapters somewhere in the 4k-5k range, and hopefully frequently. The Last Science takes priority as always though.
Special thanks to Reaver and Ace Arriande for pushing me to get this going, and to all my fellow writers whom I've stolen from been inspired by. You're all wonderful people and I love you <3
Quick reminder: Patrons get to read ahead of what's published! Also, try my other works:

My name is, well, was Hiiro Aragon.

Yeah, I was just an average man who people may have considered an otaku (otaku's for life!) and such. in the futuristic america where food deliveries were banned on sundays, and you have to buy a limited portion each day, I was just going to the grocery store on sunday. and trucks were attracted to me like a magnet, along with cars bikes and so on. luckily I wasn't THAT fat, and had once taken military combat classes. with that I managed to dodge all of them when something happened.
[How troublesome is it to kill someone these days?]
What? what the f? what was that? 
I had no time to think, and then spears were falling out of the sky! what is wrong with the world these day's? No matter, gotta run! all of a sudden I tripped on a tiny pebble, and ended up falling face up onto the ground while I was epicly doging everything! some falling spears literally made a human shape around me, immedietly restricting my movement.
[Don't worry, it'll be painless! and only 30 innocents were killed due to my actions! a new record!]
With that, I saw a huge spear falling towards me, and stabbed me through the heart. The last thing I saw was a tiny lil' girl smiling over me and laughing maniacally.

Hello, dear reader
Welcome to my first attempt to be a  writer. The leap from ""I want to do this"" to actually doing this. The story is continous through the parts of the chapters. I plan on writing bits and then add. Please don't expect actual chapters for chapters. You might find it messy. On the other way around, you are next to my couldron, as I create this, every step of the way.This is the first raw draft, writing as the heart and mind conjure the story. Afterwards, we edit. Please join me on my path.

22274,The Helena Chronicles,"Espers are really no different than humans; they look like any normal human and in general behave like any normal human.  However, there are a few key differences.  The max life expectancy of espers ranges from forty-five to fifty.  They naturally have a knack for mathematics and are extremely intelligent in general, this is because their abilities rely on the subconscious and conscious calculations.  They also have a mysterious energy source they call Focus that is generated naturally by all espers.
The continent of Elestveeve is populated by three major factions, each a governing force.  On the west of the continent, there is the Noble Houses that subscribe to the Deity Faith.  The Houses ruling with the Deity Faith as council since the religion's founding four-hundred years previous.  Controlling most of the northeast is WITCH, an organization ruled by powerful espers; claiming the mysterious Genesis as their capital, they are a whispered myth among much of the continent's less technically advanced residents.  In the southeast you have Tech City, a towering monolith of a capital with four sky layers and metropolis' leveled deep underground; it is a city brimming with technical advancement and cyber integration.  Each faction contends with one another for their evolutionary ideology, by devout religious worship to receive miraculous gifts, unique genetic lineage to obtain ESP, and technological integration to become something more than human.
Helena, a young genius and esper, awakes in a dark room with only fuzzy memories and the company of seven other children.  She must determine how she got there and how to get back to where she came from.
Warning:  Due to time constraints, I don't have the time to keep up on my three stories; therefore, Helena will need to go in a stasis chamber until I can find more time to write between work and life.  I love my first girl so much!  however, it seems she is the least popular among the fans (the poor girl T_T).  This world is much bigger than my other two novels and I'm not giving up on it, but simply having to put her on ice.",368

Most Aeon physically resembles animals, though some resemble plants or objects with animal-like facial and other features. It is not clear whether most Aeon classified as natural living things, though they are often treated as non-living organisms.
Nearly a century has been passed since the first generation Aeon coming to Earth. Now, there is a violent and bloody massive war called Great Aeon War where many people died along with Aeon by using them in the war to fight as well as using man-made weapons such as tanks, fighter planes, guns, etc.

Freidrech newly arrived in his own nation's capital city, which is so foreign to him compared to his village's idyllic and nondiscriminatory atmosphere, after he is forced to come. Now, he is facing a royal prince and tells him to bow.
This draws out one of his late father's teachings from the deepest recesses in his mind. ""The blood of your great ancestors runs in your veins. Don't easily bow down to anyone, or accept suppression by any being, not even from a monarch, unless you pledge your allegiance to him. Also, giving in to oppression is directly telling the oppressor that you're easy prey and open for manipulation.""
He is uncertain on how to face this oppression right now. Will he bows or not? What will he do to uphold his father's words while keeping his life safe?
As for the prince, Theodrech has nothing to do with Freidrech, so he wishes to let this slip, but the boy opens his mouth and proposes the most ludicrous challenge he ever heard and triggers his curiosity.
""I, Freidrech Goederf Gerboud, son of the late Village Chief Louvel Gerboud of Wrilon, will challenge you, Your Highness, to a battle of riddles… If you win, I will not only bow but be your servant for the rest of my life.""
This amuses the prince. It is the first he met a boy of the same age who is not intimidated by the air of authority he projects. Rather, this boy challenges him.
""Why are you so headstrong? In fact, bowing to me is an honor. You saw the King's noble Knights. When they saw me, they bowed,"" says Theodrech, testing Freidrech.
""Allow me to be forward, Your Highness. For me, bowing to a monarch does not guarantee loyalty. If I were you, I rather have men who stand straight in my presence but who got my back, than bowing men who are dreaming of my death,"" replies Freidrech.
The prince’s curiosity increases. A huge smile is seen on his face. Prince Theodrech decides to take Freidrech under his wing.
Little did they know, this boy who Prince Theodrech takes in as his confidant and friend in the most ridiculous fashion is someone indispensable in his life and the one who can help him succeed the throne when he almost believes he has lost.
Thus, the Tales of the Legendary Scholar begins.

The guardians of planet Earth have their hands full as the Apocalypse approaches.  One particular protector has found what appears to be the only hope of survival for planet Earth's population from the Demons that will threaten to over run the lands.  While many of them are considered of dark origins and evil intentions have ruled some of them their whole existence, it is the right moment along the time line that can change their future for the better.  At least that is her hope.
Book One of The Dark Heros Saga brings the origins of Dante to life.  From his lowly beginning of a park ranger, he will find a new purpose to his existence.  Once he encounters the evil ones of the night, his life will be transformed.  If not for the love of a woman and the guiding hand of Van Helsing himself, Dante would likely have stumbled his way into unending darkness and despair.

Hey there it's the author. When you're reading this story I would like you to be aware of a few things. First, the fantasy elements will not come into the story until later on. And second, there is no gaurantee that the story will be finished. I will try to keep it going, and hopefully I can, but life sometimes gets in the way. And by the time I get back to it I usually will have lost the spark that kept it going. Still, I will work to make sure that doesn't happen. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

“...”
Thanks to the amount of light novels and LitRpg that I read, somehow this doesn’t freak me out. But there’s several things that I want to ask right now.
1. I’m in the middle of my high school entrance exam, can’t this transparent screen just appear on more proper time?
2. Why is the language is in English? Maybe because this is the most common language on Earth?
3. Since when do I understand english? Not that I complain about it though.
Anyway, I can’t finish my test with this screen blocking my vision but my  instinct tells the moment I pick no, I won’t be able to understand English like this again.
And so I chose yes.

Since such a feat is out of my league, I’ll settle for the run-down library this will end up in. This will be a live journal of my exploration of Arcadia, written using my blessed eyes. By combining the powers of their photographic memory and the ability to create pocket realities, I’ll document my travels and unravel the truth behind these myths and legends.

Gone are the choices of Classes and Archetypes, starting kits and pay-for features. In the bowels of Tartarus, only your effort matters.
Once more I welcome you to Tartarus Online. We are going to have a Hells’ of a time.”
These were the words that really caught Riley Culman’s attention while watching the promotional video the two guys in nicely tailored suits had brought to him. The two men had come with an invitation, and an offer; which sounded more like a deal with a devil, but was seriously on the up-and-up. Not that these guys from Astarte Entertainment had any reason to lie or be evasive on the subject, given just how massive a corporation Astarte is.
Beta Test Tartarus Online. Explore a brand new world. Sleep away his chair-bound life while testing the latest in long term virtual reality immersion technology. And maybe, just maybe regain the mobility robbed from him by an accident as a child. It really sounded all too good to be true to Riley, thus the feeling of making a deal with a devil.

Power, food, infrastructure. All of it was gone and what came after was worse as humans were no longer top of the food chain.
Yet the imminent destruction of the 21st century re-opened a veil that had kept the world safe from hidden dangers, or maybe it was the other way around. Time will tell.
In our story, the Protagonist rises from the ashes of the apocalypse. A desert child soldier nurtured by tragedy and death looking for an escape to fill the void in his heart. By chance, in his hand, he held a blade with immense possibilities.

22512,Ascension of Singularity,"In realms where Immortals are gods and devils among men, a Post-Human descended. Hailing from a distant realm, the Post-Human was ordered to conquer it all. But when desires and morality intersect, what is sin, what is justice? A sage can be a butcher, a tyrant can be a saviour. Only victors shall write history!

A/N: Story type is largely Xuan Huan and will have irregular update schedule. Chapter length range from 2 - 3 K words each and may have some grammatical errors. While this fiction isn't my first work, I intend to continue it for some time. I hope readers understand that there will be lot of mistakes.",48
22513,"Oh great, another dungeon reincarnation!","A recent addition to the afterlife comes face to face with a god.
Not the old, kind one mind you, but the kind who screws around with people for fun.
In this case, our main character, forced to be a dungeon!
It wouldn't be so bad, except the god refuses to give a menu, tutorial, or even a fairy! Now armed only with memories of Earth, our lead character is forced to change their life as a dungeon with moral standards to a crystal bent on deception, twists, and domination!
Please note: The character will be a dungeon, obviously, but will still have human emotions. They will not care if they kill or do other things to living beings. That said, they can still have feelings. There will be immoral acts. Also this one may be a bit slow moving at the beggining (EDIT: Apparently I have not made this clear enough. It is slow at the beginning, which is -A New Beginning-. and as a dungeon who just got revived and has human-like emotions, he/she gets antsy, as would anyone.) There will be no LitRPG boxes or text(except for other's points of view), but it is later added. 
Release dates: Well you see the exact release scheduale is... whenever i feel like it! No, i'm not going to ditch you, but I have changed my ways from a frequent short chapter releaser to a delayed, long chapter pleaser. The first arc will keep it's 1,500 to 3,500 words per chapter, but for future releases expect at minimum 2500.

Basil von Doom is a powerful dungeon keeper with a simple mission: to bring ruin and destruction upon civilized worlds at the height of their decadence and stagnation. Much like his father before him, the new master of House Doom is a prodigy of war, yet the venerable minions of his household still hold strange loyalties toward his missing ancestor, silently comparing the legendary rage of his father to the more pragmatic approach of the son. Adding to Basil’s frustrations is the lack of accomplishment he feels for his work, with the dungeon keeper often taking on handicaps just to give his enemies a fighting chance. With all the power and wealth one could ever dream of already within his grasp, Basil now finds that the achievements of others kindle more joy in his heart than his own crushing victories. Thus Basil has taken up mentoring the next generation of dungeon keepers to try and diagnose the cause for his own lack of passion. With his apprentice, Elnora, managing most of the daily work around the dungeon, Basil can finally turn his attention towards his personal concerns, such as tackling the shadow of his legendary father that still looms large over him.",323

On January 1st, people all over the world started their day listening to a news story on a new supernatural phenomenon and while it took the world by storm, would only escalate and remain unsolved for years to come. The so called “Fade” phenomenon was quite simple to analyze yet impossible to explain, and it gets its name by the sporadic disappearance of thousands of children and teens overnight.
 
The first theories revolved around a massive human trafficking ring, due to the age of those who disappeared. These theories quickly dissolved due to the lack of evidence and continued disappearance of children no younger than 10 and adults no older than 20. On the first day of every new years, more would disappear. In 2012 it was estimated to be about 5,000, the next year was 10,000 and was continually doubled as the world fell into panic and fear, fear that it would be there children taken next.
 
It wouldn't be until 2015 when 40,000 people “faded” that the world would receive its first answers, as unbelievable as it was. About 3,400 of the first generation “faded” would return. They told stories of other worlds, different worlds then there own, some told stories of worlds like earth where technology was well developed and yet strange. Some experienced a far different life were instead of technology, it was magic that reigned supreme. Many were interrogated by their government, others were interviewed on Tv and shared their story were many noticed inconsistencies, most notably the time spent in there new world. Some had spent almost six years, while some spent only one or two. But there was only one thing they all had in common: all there worlds were at war.",4

He lived in a rented apartment in the decent district, a well-paying job, and more student debt than he cared to think about being steadily paid off. Yet he was absolutely miserable. He spent his days living like a zombie, a slave in all but name to corporate.  His only joy these days it seems was reading comics and writing fanfics. SI ones. Choke full of power fantasies and large harems. Yeah, even he had to admit he was a loser. His only redeeming feature seemed to be his photographic memory and the library's worth of comics and books he has read.
Yet, when fate took pity on him and had John transported into the Marvel Universe, he was only all too happy to oblige. A second chance to make something of himself. Is he going to finally have the comfortable life he wanted? Will he laze away relying on his past life's knowledge or does he want more this time? Will his ambition and hard work lead to sweet fruits, or will it rot away in the darkness hiding beneath the colorful costumes of the hero's society?
 
Now with crossovers! Be warned if you don't like to see OCs messing up the timeline or DC and other stuff showing up. I swear I'm not randomly adding stuff and there is a legitimate (as far as comic books and fanfics can be) plot reason why.
(I'll be honest, I don't know ""cannon"" marvel really... I watched some movies and animated series as a kid, but I haven't picked up a comic in years. This is just some light-hearted and casual writing for fun. If there are any errors or something you think would be cool please let me know.)

Between these worlds there lies the dark fog of the astral planes, where demons and feral spirits lurk in the shadows of existence.  From the abyssal dungeons of the underworld to the farthest dimensions of the universe there are countless powers unfathomable to man, powers which if unleashed would lay waste to creation.  Seeping through the cracks of reality is an endless stream of wild magic, wearing down the walls which separate worlds and piercing them with fissures. Standing firm against these chaotic tides are the Good Folk, the crafters and stewards of creation, who constantly rebuild and fortify the gateways between worlds.  And manning the gates are those servants of the Good Folk who are their chosen soldiers from the ranks of man. Those born of earth who pledge their lives to the defense of their world and its people. 
Those who are called Gate Marshals.

He invested all of his being into creating a balanced system of perpetual renewal — a self-sustaining cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. But his brother, the Breaker, is determined to see that alignment ripped asunder.
Chabar is a world balanced delicately between two stars. Its inhabitants have heard hints and rumors of the unending conflict between Builder and Breaker, but those are just ancient tales, steeped in mysticism and widely disregarded. When the Breaker is unexpectedly awakened from the primordial slumber in which his brother had trapped him, he starts out on a campaign of destruction to undo it all. A few select individuals find themselves unwittingly faced with the impossible task of stopping him from ending their world.",2

With a fulfilling career and happy family, what more could Chie possibly want? Still, it's human nature to strive towards self-actualization and the devious Empress knows exactly what Chie's innermost drives are. From the Empress's fortress in the glacial mountains of The White Imperium VRMMORPG, she's formulated her machinations and isn't going to give up until she's forced Chie to take up the quest for the Mirror of Truth—even if it means hurting Chie's husband Ken and their son.
Ken ""Yamabushi Rock"" has always been there for Chie.

As the Empress's hypnotic gaze draws Chie and Ken deeper into the desolate naraka hell of The White Imperium with its supernatural yokai of Japanese myth, they learn that the human heart is more unbelievably twisted and horrific than the unhuman.

Hello,
I am a professional copywriter who has mainly worked in soul-crushing corporate positions.  Inside sales operations, CRM database administration, and email lead gen... yuck.
And I read terrible, escapest sci-fi.  Sometimes to get through the day.  But, mostly I like it.  Alway have.  Always will.
For a while now I have commented on other stories here on RRL.  I wanted to contribute more.  To share my love for and experience with old school science fiction and fantasy.
Not just Heinlein, Asimov, and Clarke.  But Haggard, Burroughs, Wells, Norton, DeCamp, Howard, Lovecraft, Leiber... all the giants from the golden age. The guys who inspired the modern space program and a million pages of pulp.
I'm currently reading Mother Of Learning (here on RRL) and The Deathworlders (off-site and don't care, HFY all day).
And I suddenly had a question
THIS IS A HUGE SPOILER

Spoiler: Spoiler


What if the entire surface of Mars was an intelligent Von Neumann Machine bent on 'perfecting' all life?



I will be exploring some of my favorite tropes sprinkled with my favorite references once a month as the MC tries to organize himself against the biggest bad I could think of.
Hopefully, I will become a better writer in the process... This is my first effort to write something marketable outside of business academia or the corporate marketing neighborhood.

Alongside this, each cast member is given three secrets they are able to reveal at any point for an advantage in the killing game as well. However, one of these secrets is their name, and revealing that secret will result in a minor ""punishment"" as well.

#Author's Note
The novel is organized like this:Regular Chapters (Act, Title, Part (ranging from 1 to 9))Draft Chapter DisclaimerDraft Chapters (Entry Number, Perspective, Title, Part (ranging from i to ii))
Regular chapters are edited chapters that reflect the story aspect more while Draft chapters reflect plot progression more. An occasional interactive chapter will appear in the drafts but nowhere in the regular chapters. Expect changes when reading between Regular and Draft chapters as some events in the story may change in length or entirely removed/changed. Only read the draft version if you want a future view and/or opinion on the story and design elements.
 The main character is a human from a fantasy world reincarnated as a devil. The story possesses Reincarnators, Transmigrators, and Summoned Persons. though mainly focusing on Magic and other abilities such as Aura and Skills. Wizards (those who prepare arcane spells) and Mages (those who use elemental magic) are separate but seen as the same by common inhabitants of the world but clearly defined as different by more influential persons and by the circles themselves. The main character WILL not be a Mage or Wizard but will incorporate mana into her attacks to aid her as does any high-rank combatants. The system in the novel quantifies a person's abilities and keeps record of them but does not define natural ability, occasionally granting special abilities as skills to a person once prerequisites are met. There is no leveling system and no occupational systems in the novel featuring only a stat based and skill based system.
Also, this novel is my first and will most likely be trash.",54

PROLOGUE:
My first coherent thought of my life was after eating a blue glowing bug that had hopped into my coop. My thought was “holy fuck that tasted good” I surprised myself because my thoughts had been purely based on emotion and need up until this point. You know, like hungry, thirsty, time to shit, or it’s time to fuck. But after this first thought, they came flowing in faster “where the fuck can I get more of those glowing bugs?!?” 
I looked around my coop and noticed that while I had known that I didn’t live alone in my coop I had never taken into account that I shared my coop with so many others. There had to be at least 25 others that looked like me. But I immediately disregarded this realization as I noticed that my main goal of finding more of the glowing bugs was about to be realized as more of the glowing bugs were headed straight for our coop. There had to be over forty of the little rainbow glowing fuckers. 
I let out an excited “BAWCOCK!” and immediately I was surrounded by my coop mates as we all noticed the coming bugs. I was the only one that had eaten one. But it was deeply ingrained into all of our brains that “bugs = good” so we waited excitedly as the different colored glowing bugs hopped closer and closer.",1

Among other things, a story about growth, grit, and being better than the person you were yesterday.
 
Here's my rambling on why I'm writing Journey West 5000.

Journey West 5000 is my crazy ambitious writing project to adapt a classic epic called ""Journey to the West"" for a global, modern audience. It's a sci-fi story disguised as fantasy, and has some road trip + monster of the week elements (as does the original Journey to the West).
No system, definitely no harem, gradual power progression. Hmm, what else can I put here so potential readers know what to expect?
My writing style for now is mostly ""show don't tell"", because I believe that readers don't need to have everything pointed out to them, and that they should be allowed to make up their own minds about characters based on the actions of those characters. I'm also trying to be less long-winded (a weakness pointed out by some friends) in order to write according to something Neil Gaiman said, which is to write as though I'm the one who has to pay for every word, not the reader. This will bring down my chapter word counts, and might drive away potential readers, but I believe there's value in learning to compress and be concise.

A battle against time to stop the Necromancer from reaching the plains of ash and opening a portal to bring back the demon lords and the horde is a secondary objective - the Aspire guild will always complete the contract and Kadin will not be the exception.The world itself is a High Fantasy world with all sort of magical creatures, including Elfs, Orcs, Vampires, Demons, giant spiders, enchanted weapons, magical runes, and wizardry - almost every one in this world can use magic - but only a few specialise in it.The story is completely from the perspective of Kadin, so there is no jumping between characters. Plus I have purposely not described what Kadin looks like as since this is all from his view, I want each reader to picture him in their own way. Finally I am open to any feedback or criticism, I am writing this because I enjoy it - but I will always look to improve my skills. Thanks all",4

In a sense you’re either screwed or screwed but you know why.
 
I didn’t really read Naruto when I was a kid. However, had I known that it would be useful in death, I would have! And I’m certainly regretting it now!
 
————————————
A definite AU for Naruto. I’m going to remove some parts and add some others for the sake of plot holes(so if something doesn't seem quite right it's probably intended... maybe), but I’ll try to stick to as close to how the Naruto-verse works. Also, say goodbye to canon!
 
Also, disclaimer, I do not own Naruto as that belongs solely to Kishimoto. I do, however, own this story.

There is another much quicker way however, through gaining experience from killing monsters and using that experience to unlock it.

Finished flushing out every kink in the story, smoothing out every wrinkle in the class tree, and memorising every pathway to 'catch' a girl in the spin off dating game, he finally lays down to rest.
He starts to wonder how to make it more interactive. How to make it more exciting. I wish I had another point of view.
No rest for the weary however, as instead of getting a magical portal leading him to a unknown world, he trips over a laundry basket. Landing face first on the opening screen of the game he created himself, he finds out he landed in a new world, getting the new 'point of view' he wanted.
Other than a terrible headache he soon finds out that the content of not only the books, but every single one of his creations are put together into the universe before him. Having previous knowledge he doesn't have to worry about unknown creatures, missing world events, or even getting a gal. Only one problem...
He's level one.

From Author:
Hi Everyone. 
This story is something I wanted to write for a while. I have an overarching plot idea and direction this story is going to go, but it is mostly going to be exploratory writing.
 
Unfortunately, I do not consider myself good at writing, spelling, style, etc and quite literally have no experience with novels what so ever (other than reading). On top of that English is not my native language so expect errors, misspellings and lots, lots of punctuation issues.
 
And this is the reason for the direct address - I would greatly appreciate any constructive feedback and comments pointing out my mistakes so I can fix them.
Also feel free to speculate about the story and characters - But remember that I might feel obliged to ‘steal’ some ideas.",1

23079,Re:Hammer,"Your average Reborn Game System story, similar to The Gamer and Solo Leveling. Written for fun rather than novilization like the others, so it is smaller and less intense. It is set in an AU Warhammer (based on a slightly modified version of Warhammer Fantasy's End Times. (Modified because the real setting was a catastrophe. There will be no exploding moons or beating the God Of Indulgence because they overindulged, and no Slaans fucking off to space. People shall use their brains and not just ""lol cuz I can"" bs like Todbringer thinking the end of the fucking world was the best time to go persue you interracial Yaoi rivalry with a Beastlord). So you might notice names and events but don't expect it all to go the same way. And the Main Character is not the only Player in this game~

23118,Midara: Requiem,"""When the alternative is extinction, all acts, no matter how heinous, are permitted.""
The story of a little necromancer who only wants to play with abominations against all that is holy dollies and her horsey, Mister Clackybones.
 
Welcome to the novelization of one script I designed for a video game setting I call Midara (I selected the name of a genus of moths for symbolism purposes, not to be confused with anything else). Once upon a time, I dreamed of the setting being the next Final Fantasy. Long story short: Nope.

It's here that the individual known as Nemesis Jones, a self-styled private investigator, arrives, stumbling onto the doorstep of a curious bookstore called Beaumort's. He's here in search of answers, but all he seems to find is more questions - like the strange girl who arrived at Beaumort's shortly after him, and the peculiar stranger who just may have the answers he seeks. After he stumbles upon a conspiracy tied far too closely for comfort to his best friend, it's up to him and some other nosy eccentrics to unravel the mysteries of the city one by one, beginning with the murder at the Theatre Obscura.
Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, all of this is explicitly outlined in Nemesis' job description.

Notes
         1: It is my first attempt at writing anything so any constructive advice is more than welcome. if your comment will be just to insult, don't do it, you will waste time typing and I will waste time reading it and not giving a damn about it.
          2: To make it worse English is not my mother language. I'm still learning and through reading and talking is not a problem for me, writing is my weak spot. Though not the only one and not the most important, this is one of the reasons I decided to start writing this novel.
           3: I do not own the artwork used as a cover, I found it on google, I liked it A LOT and decided to use it. At the time I tried to contact the creator but received no answer and if he wants me to remove it I will.  
With that out of the way, I hope you enjoy it and sorry if you don't :P.",387

How would you react if one day you found yourself in an environment running on tropes and clichés? 
For allegedly average high-schooler Leonard Dunning, this rhetorical question became uncomfortably real on the day he woke up on a strangely pristine island country in the middle of the Atlantic. Without memories, surrounded by countless characterless placeholders, and with a classic harem protagonist and his various love interests for friends, he tries his best to fit in and figure out what's going on. 
That would be difficult enough already, yet his investigation into the rules governing the world, sabotaging the harem tropes, and his odd blend of outside-context knowledge, unique abilities, and a penchant for causing trouble wherever he goes, ends up drawing the attention of the world's nebulous narrative...

23179,KOBOLD,"Rebirth into a world unlike any other seems to be a running fad — except when you're reborn into the body of a monster, that is. Originally an upstanding guy in his prior life, Baik never expected to enter any sort of world as a kobold. Less so did he expect to be special, standing above and stronger than the average kobold. As his tribe generation's ""Kobold Prince"", the readers follow Baik on his journey into Daesal as one of the world's most hated creatures. The entire world lies ready, prime for a conqueror... prime for a new Kobold King.
KOBOLD is a release-when-ready work, which will prioritize dropping one or two chapter(s) at a time.
KOBOLD (or go home) is the story about a nice guy put in the shoes of a villainous creature -- it draws inspiration from Re:Monster, Overlord and similar Isekai thematically while orienting on a mix of deadly-fast combat between long-standing arcs. Things aren't nice in Daesal and the people aren't either; Baik will encounter and experience this firsthand alongside the readers throughout his entire life. It's a story about a good person who has no choice but to be the bad guy, struggling with balancing what people expect with what would have been the ""right thing"" to do in our world. Survival will be hard, for him and any who follow him.",321

Save the people and destroy the monsters. The only question is if she will rise to the occasion, or will the monsters in the countryside- and those of her past- cut her down?

My current goal is to maintain a 3 cha / week for about a month or so before allowing early access since it will take time for me to build up the chapters. For now If you would like to support me please vote for my novel as it would tempt more people to read my novel and if you find anything, and I mean anything that you don’t like whether grammar or even something in the plot or abilities please do leave a comment even if you consider it rant I will still read it. ::",11

Hello, author-san here!This is my first story, set up in a fantasy world. It's based on the medieval and steam era where magic is rare and alchemy is used widely used as a weapon by people.
There would be lots of action, adventure, betrayal, tragedy, romance, etc. ahead.
Warnings-The mc is a bit mean and foul-mouthed, introvert. There would be strong language and lots of monologue narration by the MC. The stories are fast-paced and progressing faster. The chapters update would be unstable, depending on my daily life. You would get fast updates... or slow.Also, English isn't my first language. So don't expect perfect grammar :(
P.S. - I would like some constructive critique and feedback!It fills my motivation gauge and increases that rate of chapter/week.

Technology that feels more akin to magic, so powerful it can allow a single person to dominate a star system. But these relics of another time have been left well-defended and behind bewildering and impenetrable security measures. 
There are those who are compatible with the alien technology, who can augment themselves to face the evermore extreme protocols in the depths of the alien ruins, and by doing so attain greater power. And there are those who just want to sell what they find to the highest bidder.
The rewards are high, but you have to be prepared to go further and risk more to discover the greatest secrets of a civilisation that vanished long before the first human walked upright. Secrets that could irrevocably change humanity's future, or end it.","2,583"

The world of Judas Valiant is bustling with Fantasy and a touch of Steampunk. This is an original tale made as an homage to the famed Studio Ghibli and Guillermo Del Toro, all the while taking inspiration from numerous animes and fantasies alike (Too many to love! Too many to name!). 
When a bloody catastrophe strikes a young boy's home, desperation brings about an unknown visitor. Plagued with gut-wrenching fear and an oncoming spiral into madness comes the boy's only hope of survival. Ripe with desperate opportunity, arrives the many-faced creature rushing to make a deal worth several lifetimes.
""To find your way into your parent's arms again, you'll need to become a Valiant."" He explained.
""A Valiant?"" I responded suspiciously.
""...One must perform a 3-part task in which you must demonstrate the essence of a Mother, the essence of a Father, and earn the essence of a Gaurdian."" He explained with haste.
Innocently playing into the unknown visitor's tempting hand, the boy agrees to a deal hopelessly intertwined with a journey like no other and is sent to the mysterious and massive city of New Dwarden. Faced with outrageously colorful characters, towering and seemingly alien animal life, and even talking frogs-lemur's, the boy must adapt to grand adventure to complete his impossible task. 
This a steampunk story about a second chance at life, one that grows beyond life and death.

VERSE follows the stories of Kirev, Ledger Aerys, and Amelie Vail — three pilots who control a roster of divine gods from ancient mythology — on their quests to become the greatest summoners in the world.

All great wars have a beginning.

Creator's Dilemma:
So I have this major issue that I need your help with!! I find myself constantly creating new projects (over and over again.) I never know which one to devote my time to... So I've come to Royal Road to hopefully solve this little dilemma.
The idea is that I'm going to just submit my projects and whichever ones gain interest and followers will be the ones I pursue, and the others will simply be put on a backburner.
So without further ado, here are some of my stories. Please follow the ones you like to show interest. I'll continue to write for the ones that people like, but I'm sure there will be some that people don't -- which is why I'm here. As the creator, I can't tell which ones are good and which aren't. You can though!

23346,Humanity's Ruin,"At the beginning of time, there were deities known as the Ten Great Immortals. These Immortals silently existed in a void for centuries without a way to use their power. In hope of filling in the void, they constructed a world known as E’den. The Immortals yearned to bring life into their new world, so they created plants, beasts, and mortals. The Immortals favored the mortals as they had resembled them the most. The mortals were granted many wishes in exchange for remaining pure.
For centuries, E’den seemed to prosper in peace and harmony, but as E’den continued to develop, the mortals became tainted by their unquenchable desire for more. War, murder, rape, poverty, theft, betrayal, slavery, and destruction spread across the lands of E’den with each passing moment. The impending demise seems almost certain as one day the Immortals received a troubling prophecy. In order to save plague-ridden E’den, they prophesized two mortal champions. Will the mortals be able to fulfill their destiny and restore paradise in E'den? Or will they fall victim to the pestilence that precedes them?

He doesn't use electricity, travels by horse and carriage, and eats what he sows in a community with a traditional lifestyle, rural and voluntarily separated from modern society. A community that for foreign eyes is frozen in time.
When he decides to experience the modernity that he heard so much about the cities outside of his region, a theft forces him to stop on his way to the capital city. The situation would be manageable if it weren't for a detail. In his community they live under the principles of nonviolence!
In a world where each being is born with an identifying color, can summon a weapon and fight with the power of the elements -or what is known as trinity or three characteristics of a user-, villains abound because of this power that each person can easily use. Ignorant of the life in the country's most important city, Saul will have to face culture shock to adapt to this outside world unknown to him, and to the people and events that will make him fall into the bowels of the world of temptations.

23466,A Castle in a Teacup,"One might say that to anger forces beyond the ken of fragile breakable mortals is a bad idea, others might say that meddling in dark forces with little chance of gain is also a bad idea, they would both be right by on all counts but they forget to mention also how incredibly stupid combining both of those things are. Stupid people don’t last so long on the mystic side of things, normal folks who wander over to the other side  have a tendency to do one of two things, either A. figure out that the best thing to do is keep their head down and not draw attention from any entity that refers to humanity as “you mortals” , or B. something horrifying happens to them. As you may have guessed I fell into the second category, mostly because I thought there was a third option. See I though there must be an option C, an option where I got to end up not as some shitty back ally wizard cowering at the chance of discovery, praying that one of my wards or spells wouldn’t be noticed  by something that goes bump in the night. No I would be the one who rose above all that. I would never have to be afraid. Well I made a good attempt at it that’s for damn sure, but unfortunately for me it turns out there is not an option C.

That is why most of the strong races have neglected them, so when all the other forces were exhausted, they bared their fangs. This is not a story about the rise of those humans, no, this story tells the tale of the beginning of the end.

The Earth had just survived the aftermath of Ragnarok. With most of the landmass turning into wastelands, the people had fought over the remaining fertile earth and amongst all odds, an empire strong enough shook the world and unified it. Years passed and eventually, that empire had begun to rot due to graft and corruption. This resulted in the rise of a man who had revolted against the vile treatment that the citizens received.

He who had once fought for his family, his friends, his people. He continued to ruthlessly slay anyone who stood in his way until one day, he was betrayed by the comrades he trusted, the very country he served, and the very people that he saved. They were the ones to betray him after all that he’s done for their sake. Now, he has come back from the dead for his revenge. He is an Einder.

He knew it made no sense and yet he couldn't deny it. No matter what others might say he had to meet her.

From her window she saw herself leave that place, run across the forest and escape the suffocating fate that awaited her. And yet she knew that the chains that bound her were needed and well deserved. For she was all too aware of the dark horror of who she truly was. And so she accepted her fate.

The three great neighboring kingdoms: Mystral, Atlas, and Mantle, saw the weakness behind the Empire's walls, and disaster soon fell. War broke, with the three great kingdoms forming an alliance to defeat the Empire of Vale. 
After the great war, the world was in ruin. Mysterious creatures known as the Grimm started to emerge, the once bountiful magic the world once had was now gone, and even the moon was shattered by some mystic force.
Generations after, Civilization had started to rebuild itself in the East, with the three great kingdoms as its foundation. But the lands to the West have become infested with Grimm, and no normal human would dare travel to those lands.
Civilization soon felt threat near the borders, new religions soon came about, new fighting styles, new power sources known as Dust became more prevalent, as well as the manifestation of Aura and Semblances. This was also the time in where mutations would occur in children from being exposed to the Grimm, and these children were called the Faun.
A promising huntress, the young Ruby Rose, after the death of her mother and graduating the Signal Combat School, she now heads off to Beacon Academy to become an official huntress and to explore the lands to the west.
Jaune Arc, a swordsman with a legacy to to uphold, enters Beacon Academy in order to gain power and reclaim the lands he lost to the creatures of Grimm long ago.

23593,I Was Reincarnated as Someone's Mana??,"My name is Magnus Karlsson, and by a series of rather unfortunate events that I had absolutely no say in, I was killed and reincarnated.
In this story, you will follow Magnus as he tries his very best to survive in a world that's been thrown into chaos, together with the man whose mana he is, Allan Woodsworth. Well, not a man per se, more of a little boy who has no idea what the fuck is going on, but, you know... I'm sure it'll be fine. Nothing bad will happen to the pair. Nope. No abandoned kids here.
Anyhow. 
The world that Magnus has been thrown into is one perversed by the will of a great mage who, three thousand years ago, decided that it would be a great idea to infuse all the people of the earth with so-called ""orbs"". These magical crystals allow their handler to control and generate mana, which they can then use to become mages. Most barely use them, since the mana cost of doing such a little thing as a fireball spell is absolutely ridiculous. Said mage, Theodore Cromwell, Magnus used his resources to infuse not only humans with orbs, but animals as well, giving rise to what the mage community calls ""horrid perversions of nature"", but what the common folk calls ""monsters"". Orbs can be used for much, and it is through orbs that people keep track on their level of mana and such, and destroying the orb of a monster is A, the only way to kill it and B, a good way to absorb extra mana and raise ones level. 
It is such an orb that Magnus has been tranformed into.
 
 
------
To those that care, I'm very sorry about the title, it's just that, well, it's very good to be blunt about isekais like this since people such as myself search precisely for this, so having super-serious names like ""The Magnus of the World of Orbs"" would turn people wanting a simple and fun isekai off. 
I hope you give this story a fair chance!

The group who created the Sphere already tried and failed with several modifications, because the original computer-like dungeon cores are too inflexible to handle changing approaches. So they try another type of solution – taking souls from other worlds to try to find a solution before the Sphere Cycle breaks down completely.
The General was one of the best soldiers of his world, rising from the ranks of a private through Officer School to the highest command with honors. But when his world faced a zombie apocalypse, even that was not enough and he had to make the ultimate sacrifice.
Now he is asked for a repeat performance of planning and controlling a dungeon and its spawns in a world that he knows nothing about…
 
But what is the Sphere really? What is that [Xenotic conversion] he has to go through to even enter the Sphere? Something is really strange and he will have to find out what is going on to get to his promised rewards – whatever they will be.
 
Being a soul in a dungeon core means that the General has better chances of finding hints to the truth about the sphere – a knowledge that would help him survive. And no, the sphere is NOT a virtual reality – the key to its secrets is the place where it was physically constructed (Author’s hint).
 
This is a dungeon core story - but there are quite a number of things that I will do differently than common to those stories.
1) I will describe the floors when they are explored, NOT when they are build.
Yes, that will mean it will take longer to get to those parts - but I think describing floors both when they are build and when they are explored destroys quite a lot of chances for suspense when adventurers enter the dungeon. After all, if you as the reader already know where the traps are, then you can't really be surprised when the surfacers encounter them.
2) How the world works (and how not) is an integral part of the story, so it will be explained
I'm a world-builder first and the Sphere is NOT a regular world (as hinted in the synopsis above). Things will work differently than in your 08/15 default dungeon core stories - as the General and Gunny have already learned in the second arc (and more of that is already scheduled for the next weeks (July/Aug 2019) when the Sky Arrows continue to explore and evaluate that strange dungeon)
If you don't like these premises, then I'm sure you'll find a lot of other Dungeon Core stories more to your liking. But if you are interested in more than ""Dungeon builds another room and corridor in medieval earth"" and are not afraid of a longer and slower story, then go on.
 
I have two more stories in the Sphere, although they both have lower priority than this one:
Shaleen the Wanderer (Adventurer, NSFW) (currently on hold after some chapters)
Info's on the Sphere (System Docu and Short Stories) (irregular updates when needed)

23603,LIve,"The bell rang cutting our teacher off in mid-sentence, and I began stuffing my books and papers into my book bag. I moved with a sense of urgency, as if somehow the clock might change its hand if I dallied. “We’ll pick up where we left off on tuesday.” My psychology teacher Mr. Snell called out. “Everyone please read pages 240 to 280 in the text. Don't work too hard!” The last part he said with a smile, knowing the likelihood of anyone actually reading the pages was almost zero. Besides not working too hard was advice he planned on taking, he was headed into his backwoods to go fishing as soon as everyone left.  “So Nova are you going to come, or no?” My best friend Deku Midoriya asked me with a lopsided grin on his face. “You know you want to.” Me being a scrawny, white haired 10th grader who had little interest in magic and other fictional fantasies said “No, I really don't want to. The idea of playing a LARP(LIve Action Roleplaying game) while being dressing up as wizards, and sleeping out in the woods does not seem even remotely fun.” After further thought I said ¨Fine Deku I´ll go¨. That responce marked the beginning of a very long journey that would span through not just one world but two.

23608,KING - HIATUS,"Valentia Academy for the Gifted; the top school in the country known for educating the strongest individuals to exist.
Gifteds are humans with combat powers in the form of spirit weapons. These individuals are rare in society, only ten percent meeting the criteria as powers are passed down by blood [upper-class] and luck. Among these individuals, less than zero point one percent pass the first stage. 
One day, to everyone's surprise, a non-gifted aces the admission test with perfect scores: both in combat and academics. With his charming looks, white hair, and childish personality, nobody could understand how he passed the firm doors. Who is this person? Where did they suddenly come from? And what is their purpose for coming into the school? 
And perhaps, there is more than what meets the eye.

Inspired primarily by the systems in The Legend of Randidly Ghosthound, The Genesis System, and The New World as well as by Savage Divinity, Azarinth Healer, and Shovels in Spades in general. I haven't been able to get these worlds out of my head and I've been waiting for something to fill the void left by the hiatus of Genesis, but so far nothing has scratched that itch as much as ProfoundMagician was able to with the world he created. I figure if I'm going to be thinking about this stuff as much as I do I might as well get better at writing while playing with a number of those ideas that I love. I have a number of specifics and events I want to show in the story, but a lot of the fun is coming up with ways to branch those together cohesively. This is an attempt to alleviate my depression by channeling my creativity into a hobby. Hopefully it's as enjoyable to read as it is to write.",57

Finally, Markus. The moroi who had lost his honor when Darius was killed.

23688,The Boss of Beginner’s Village,"Accardi, the World of Chaos and Glory.
A well-known virtual reality game, where players could enjoy a new life as magical beings, powerful heroes or even despicable villains. 
The game’s programmer, our protagonist, accepted a famous web novelist’s proposal and that’s how the story ‘The Rising of the Magic Swordsman’ was born. Counting with Accardi’s finely made world settings and the writer’s creativity on its peak, both the game and the novel became tremendously popular.
But before our protagonist could enjoy this popularity or plot the writer’s murder for distorting the world of Accardi, she died.
And then she reincarnated, in a place incredibly similar to her own game’s world.
Well, it wasn’t.
She didn’t know what god she offended, but the world she reincarnated into wasn’t her Accardi, but the novel’s. To make it even worse, she wasn’t just a mob character, but actually a future member of the protagonist’s harem. 
And although everything was ridiculously troublesome, there was one thing she couldn’t accept: the fact that in the novel, her precious beginner’s village would be destroyed! 
Since one of the game’s gold rules was ‘no death at the beginner’s village’, our protagonist takes her pride as the game’s programmer to protect the village!
Along the way, several individuals join her to help her goal. But as time passes by, they realized... this lass isn’t normal, is she.
So, welcome to Doveshire!
Hmm? Are you a powerful master traveling around? An highly dangerous wanted criminal? This kingdom’s King? Well, it doesn’t matter! You are all welcome at our humble village!
However... you know, right? No ~ troubles ~ allowed~

23699,Gloomhaven: Glorious Gatherers,"Gloomhaven is a tabletop RPG with dungeon-crawling and character-building aspects. It has a fairly unique combat system and a campaign mode with non-linear storyline. Be warned that reading this fiction will contain spoilers about Gloomhaven's story. Although I labeled this novel as a ""fanfiction"", you don't need to know the original material to enjoy the story.
To be honest, this project is somewhat of an experiment for me; even I have no idea where the story is heading, as this is my first playthrough of the game. I'll be rounding out the plot as I go, using the game as a framework but expanding on it to make it more fitting for a novel. I can't claim that everything will go well, but hey—I have high hopes and big dreams.
Hopefully you'll enjoy reading the story just as much as I enjoy playing the game.


""People gather lots of things; there's much that they adore.Money comes to mind first, but there's also much-much more.Some people gather experience, or more precisely, levels.Others collect memories—places seen on their travels.Some gather reputation, and political power,For others, it's ancient artifacts what they desire.
Whichever their goal, if they hear the call,The Glorious Gatherers will collect it all!""

What to expect:
I write dark shit.  I love tormenting my characters and throwing them into difficult situations.  I like forcing them to explore shit (alot of it on the darker side) about themselves and the world around them.
I also like mixing different story genres, which is why this story starts out sounding like a comedy, even when comedic or parody elements will be a light touch for the most part.
Keep this all in mind before picking up this story, if I had to try to describe it, it would be a harem / action / drama / dark / romance / smut / tragedy / parody or something like that.
And final warning, like I said, I write dark shit.  If you can't handle your favourite characters or waifu's suffering or dying, or some scenes that go far enough to cause the comments section to debate whether it counts as NTR or not, then maybe don't read this.",524

23709,Soul Core Online,"Soul Core Online was a game that few people were interested in until after it was released, due to its odd way of handling character growth but this soon changed as people started to realise just how different this game was. Unlike many of its predecessors the NPCs in Soul Core Online acted in a way that was indistinguishable from real people and the world felt alive because of this instead of the empty and sterile cities we had come to expect, even walking down the street could give you insights to how these people lived.
In my case this was the world that I had always wanted to visit and I soon found myself embroiled in the constantly changing world that is Soul Core Online.

23710,Alterlife II,"ALTERLIFE is in the vein of BREAKING BAD and READY PLAYER ONE.

John Crussel has established himself as one of the most powerful players in the game, known in Alterlife as Ace the Great. But his quest for freedom came at a price. By unleashing the virus, thousands of lives were lost, and their blood is on his hands. 
Time has passed, and with it,  the deaths seemed to have stopped - the virus is no more. Prosperity has returned to Alterlife, and to John's life. 
But the Gamemasters haven't forgotten about Ace the Great and what he has done. They lie in wait, patient and calculating. They seek to avenge their fallen brother, and are willing to use every tool in their arenal to deliver justice - even unleashing the gods themselves upon Alterlife. 
John Crussel thinks everything is back to normal. But there's a war coming to his doorstep.
And he doesn't even see it coming. 
The game setting of this book is modeled after the early MMO's and is likened to Ultima Online and Everquest. Readers can expect to find character progression in the game, quests, and items with various degrees of power and abilities. ALTERLIFE is not 'crunchy' with statistics.

Mortis Operandi is a different kind of company. One that celebrates diversity. One that celebrates value in individuals.

23721,Sanguine,"The Coles are probably the definition of a small dysfunctional family, even if they weren’t the worst in existence; they would probably be lauded as an example of the term.
The Coles were a small family though.
The father, Oliver Cole, was an asshole ex-football jock who bounced around in small paying jobs after wasting most of his life drinking, drugging and whoring.
The daughter, Stacy Cole, was smart, but had many issues including anger, trouble with authority, and occasional suicidal thoughts, and was kicked out of many a school for disruptive behaviour.
The son, Mike Cole, was innocent, and tried his best to be kind to anyone and everyone, however his own speech impediment, and slow nature only aided people to bully and belittle him, including his own father.
The Coles were indeed a dysfunctional family.
At least they were, until they got to the small town near the border between the United States and Canada, Sanguine.

23723,Distant Leaps to Circinus,"A dark fantasy story that takes place on a reborn Earth.
 

 
""With all the planets in the universe, it just had to be this one.""
 
Not many thoughts came to mind when scientists said they could provide the Earth with nearly infinite power. Humans could only think about the future, after all: they could travel to the farthest reaches of space, never worry about their electric bills again, and give rise to new and innovative technologies. With such good outcomes on the horizon, there was no way humanity would sit idle; instead, they studied perhaps the most powerful entity in the entire Milky Way.
 
It seemed that, after its appearance decades ago, the strange and unmoving black sphere was something of a godsend.
 
There will always be a reason for these things. With one touch, our very reality was but a grain of sand in an hourglass. In an instant, the Earth was gone - replaced by something… different.
 
 More than a century later, Earth’s remains have reformed into a completely different beast - a planet both alive and dead at the same time. Physics that were once understood no longer made sense, giant land masses floated in the sky, and billions of people fought for their very survival. Work, sleep, and play were no more; it was time for the world, Circinus, to reign.
 
The birth of Circinus could only be the beginning. The powerful yet ever-elusive black sphere seemed to watch the world from afar - casting light for those below, but never truly emitting light from itself.
 
What does it all mean for the children of Circinus - children born with eyes that seemed to stare into God’s heart?",26

To atone for the sin of weakness, he now wants to change the fate of his world! But having lost his immortality and power, his path is filled with danger and hardship. Follow Michael on his journey as he struggles against cosmic beings to protect all he holds dear.

23727,Paradox,"The impossible is possible, while the possible becomes nigh impossible. However, the possible still remains possible and the impossible remains impossible.This is a paradox, something that makes no sense yet has interested the human mind for many years. In this book, a paradox is merely a human with special abilities that are earned through much difficulty. When a Human becomes Paradox, the one thing they have pondered over the most is something they can now wield. A scientist who wondered how time worked has now become an immortal being due to them ceasing the time-flow within their own body, and has gained the ability to alter time to some degree. A little child who always wondered how the stars worked can now become a dazzling star, to a certain extent, gaining the firey abilities of one, and also the gravitational pull of a star if they wish to use it. The most simple of things such as wondering how to draw can become a Paradox's focus, while the most complicated of things can be used by Paradoxes, albeit only few can use them.
This paticular story follows a man become Paradox called Alexander Cooper. His Paradox abilties are unique in a sense that only he has them. His Paradox is focused on the thought of a Paradox itself, how it is created, where it stemmed from, how it functions. This has lead to him having extremely odd abilties, but most of them are actually from other Paradoxes!",1

Vic Hopper (AKA Comm.) is an ordinary boy. Well, that depends on your definition of ordinary. And boy. You see, by normal Earth standards he is not ordinary. That is because he is not from Earth. To liken it to terms you can probably understand, imagine a giraffe in antarctica. Weird right? Now imagine that giraffe is trying to camoflauge itself using only a penguin hat. Now picture steampunk goggles with dark tinted lenses. Now, you may have guessed that that giraffe is a little quirky. Except for the fact that he is wearing a brownish leather jacket, munching on a polar bear, and wearing two scarfs simultaneously, you would be wrong. Anyways, not what you expect to see there.

This is a fantasy novel with a gender-bending body-swapping protagonist. There will be NSFW chapters because it is a gender bender.

23760,My World To Live,"[Do Not Read this version, New FINAL version uploaded August 9th, 2021 as separate fiction, click to link here on RR.
Essairyn had never felt truly alive on Earth. It felt like something was missing ever since she was born, but even after nearly 20 years of mundane living, she could never pinpoint what this or the emptiness in her heart was. Suddenly, she awakens in a grandiose, primordial forest and encounters both demons and spirits in a parallel world called Sol'h'meyr. She befriends, in particular, a sassy fox-spirit named Akari who just reincarnated after three millennia. Essairyn is an abnormal human with elemental powers, and Akari is being chased by those of her dark past. Together, they set out on an adventure in a world of magic, danger, mystery, and intrigue. But this not a game. That simple adventure is actually the modest beginnings in a chain of disruptions that tear even the dimensional fabric of time and space. No one, not even Essairyn, was who she thought she was. And not even the gods can change the destiny of the universes... A single promise shook eternity’s existence. — Fantasy || Adventure || Romance || Action || Mystery || Drama || Science Fiction —
 
The My World To Live (MWTL) series, the alternative short name is Canaan, is comprised of three books symbolically named My World, To Live, and My World To Live.
Two years prior, the entire story had been planned and detailed out from start to finish before actual writing. Thus, the story will never be dropped. 
While the genre is largely Fantasy, the book is comprised of many other elements including a School Life (Magic Academy) story portion. MWTL has a lot of scattered symbolism and allusions, hence, the mystery aspect. The science fiction elements progressively become more pronounced, and the slow romance is a late bloomer. The female lead is strong and independent, and her backstory and identity unravel as drivers of the plot. Expect lots of action/fighting throughout and scattered philosophical and psychological themes arising. It's a human journey to find the essence of one's living and purpose. What kind of world do I wish to live for?
Any feedback is greatly appreciated. I hope to share the journey with you~!
 
Canaan's Original and New Covers: If you're curious about my art and the various covers I made for this series and other authors, I have a RR thread that makes free covers and shows art processes.
[October 1, 2020 Notice:
Hello, I aplogize to all followers for suddenly taking an extended hiatus. Life threw a lot at my face and then the pandemic happened, so I hadn't been able to write until around the last month when I decided to challenge myself and finish the first book in this series. I am ok now, and thank you for your patience and understanding. No words can express how much every reader means to me. RR was the first writing platform that I ever felt accomplished to any small degree, so I am forever grateful to it.
Multiples changes have been made since this final revision and writing of the ending, so please see the latest chapter detailing the update. This also includes my decision to submit this story to the 2020 Wattys contest (the deadline was Sept 30th). That means I will not be posting the updated version of this story on here until the contest is over (since I doubt I'll win anyway lol). And so, if you want to read the full, now completed (woohoo!) story, please go to my Wattpad. Thank you once again, and wishing you all the very best health and happiness! <3 ]

FINAL UPDATE, March 7, 2021:
The complete story has been re-posted after the Wattys. This version that was on Wattys is the one being re-posted. However, the Final Version (which will be on a separate book from this to remain organized, and is technically the fifth version of the story xD) will be released May 2021. For more information, please read this update linked here.
Thank you to all readers for taking this two year journey with me! <3",354

23775,On the Road to Elspar (Book 1),"The year is 1329. The Huntress' War has entered its tenth year, inflaming competing nationalisms and pitting the Confederacy of Caldrein against one of the continent's superpowers, the Tenereian Union. Desperately outnumbered, the Confederacy has relied on the prowess of its famed Caldran mercenaries, with highly-trained and experienced warbands returning from foreign conflicts to the defense of their homeland, and it is on their backs that Caldrein has successfully mounted a valiant defense for a decade. But they are losing, and day by day, with all the grace of a sledgehammer, the vast Tenereian armies take one more bit of Caldran territory, one footstep at a time.
Sixteen-year-old Neianne from the village of Caelon has submitted herself to Faulkren Academy, one of the centuries-old institutions established to train the next generation of Caldrein's elite soldiers of fortune, to learn the ways of wars for three years before embarking upon the defense of her country. Her dryad family once hailed from reclusive woodland communes isolated from Caldrein's complicated mainstream society, and her upbringing leaves the shy village girl unprepared to suddenly train alongside other apprentices from backgrounds as low as the dirty slums of Caldrein's cities and as high as the halls of aristocratic power.
Yet the war is eroding the norms and traditions that the Caldran people have long considered part of their national mythos, and the tensions within the confederacy that have long simmered under the surface - race, class, community, identity - are slowly but surely dividing its people, and Neianne must grow and discover who she really is, even as the war that she is steadfastly training for comes to its inexorable end...

On the Road to Elspar is a fantasy quest - a work of interactive fiction wherein readers get to vote on what happens next at critical junctures - that is the first entry in a story that follows Neianne of Caelon, which first began on July 20, 2016. Originally a three-part in medias res prologue to a larger story titled On the Elsparian Road, it was eventually decided that this section - which covers Neianne's three years at Faulkren Academy - become its own independent story due to length, structural, and accessibility reasons.
Despite this being a reader interactive work of fiction, due to logistical and verification concerns, voting will only be counted on its thread on the forum Sufficient Velocity, where this story originally began. As such, the content here on Royal Road serves as a story-only archive. You are, of course, entirely welcome to enjoy On the Road to Elspar as a conventional work of fiction, just as you are welcome to comment, discuss, and provide critique. But if you would like to participate in the voting, then I would be honored to welcome you on Sufficient Velocity.
To facilitate accessibility and to ensure the best reading experience, this story-only version of On the Road to Elspar will be updated at a periodic pace, even though further content exists, so as to not overwhelm new readers on Royal Road. If you enjoy this story, wish to binge it, and/or want to participate in voting immediately, you may of course read all additional content via the link provided above.

23778,A Weird Book #1,"***THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL STORY. I AM NO LONGER WRITING IT.*** 
In a world ruled by shadowy and mysterious powers; by men who are able to dominate and rule over people as humans do other animals, who view them as nothing more than animals; a world wracked with poverty and desolation; in a world where every sunrise seems a little dimmer than the one that came before it, and all hope has burned down to embers. . .
A rogue wizard summons the dungeon.
Ben, a young man without a stake in the future helps decide the fate of the world; Melmat, the disciple, carries out his master's will and prepares his final vengence, Dies Irae; Casimer, The Dungeon born in a barren desert two hours north of Las Vegas, seeks a way to survive and establish himself across the earth.
This is their story; the story of the pre-apocalyptic world.

Mysteries of the past connecting to the present. The Silent Dark that spilled more of those malicious creatures unto the world, and the Deafening Dark that blinded and silenced Menn into death and chaos. The Ashened Giant that emerged from the meteor said to be one of the God's wrath. The abandoned child who is now the Crown Heiress to the Imperial Throne of Eldia. How do these incidents connect with each other?
Alar had not expected a simple but suspicious job to lead him to meeting two mysterious figures who call themselves the Eyes of Odinn.

Wind howled in his ears, seemingly deploring his fate. A silvery cloud drifted over the mountains surrounding the compound. The roar of a river could be heard from underneath its frozen surface.
He had reincarnated many years ago. Hailed as a prodigy from his youngest age, Evan had seemingly tread on a path to invincibility. He had gotten married with his childhood sweetheart and had cultivated with a group of friends, forming a considerable power of his own. Yet now, here he was, devoid of any path to move forward, with his energy locus destroyed. His wife was dead and his branch had been kicked out of the clan.
He looked at his progeny that had been entrusted to him. The baby seemed content in his father’s strong arms, too young to understand anything but the warmth of the father’s beating heart. Signaling to the people behind him, he turned around and the procession gradually disappeared in the distance, as the sun gradually set and the stars acted as a guide.

A few quick notes.  For the easily offended, this work will have girl/girl romance, though there are no plans for any explicit sex scenes, despite the sexual content tag, which is there in case I decide on some more risque scenes.  There will be some graphic violence, including torture.  For that reason, I have selected the gore and traumatising content tags, but I hope not to take those very far either.  I will also attempt to avoid making characters cliched.  And lastly, this is purely a hobby right now, and I will post chapters as I complete them and feel they are up to my own standards.  As such I make no guarantees about release schedule, there could be multiple chapters in a week, or only 1 in a month.  That being said, thank you for reading and any constructive criticism is welcomed.",90

This means it will feature various lead characters as they live their lives -- sometimes pitifully short or majestically long -- and deal with the various incidents one might expect from a medieval fantasy town. Did a group of adventurous murder-hobos roam into town? They deal with them. Did someone steal a sweet roll? Call the town guard! Viewers will have partial interaction once in a while that will help the audience potentially shape the setting primarily through town residents and the situations that the Martell's deal with.
Some tags -- such as Harem, Female Lead, and Non-Human Lead -- may not appear in the initial story/synopsis but will most likely find their way into the story as you read. Readers can determine which Martell is currently alive by a chapter's title and opening statement.",17

As Grae tries to uncover secrets to a past that just doesn't quite add up and the strange people who keep falling into her life, she finds a breech into an alternate universe and impossible answers to her questions. But as Grae digs deeper, she finds things are becoming less black and white. In a world where nothing is as it seems, who do you trust and who do you believe?
Thank you Catherine for that amazing synopsis!

Hello Everyone, I am Vi, Cat Vi.
This is my first attempt at writing a story. I am a complete beginner at this. The closest thing to an organized story I’ve ever written is essay reports back in high school.
There might be syntax errors and weird language all over the place. So, apologies in advance.
I’ll be trying my best to make this story as interesting as possible, and with your feedback I am sure I can make something nice out of it.
Constructive criticism is appreciated. And you are welcome to comment any errors you might notice. I’ll try to fix them up as soon as I can.
For now, I don’t have a schedule. But if the story gets traction, I will try to work something out.

23969,Daydreamer (Hiatus),"I absently stared at the sky, preserving only a sliver of attention on the long, dried blade of grass which I twirled between my fingers. It was hard to tell where my mind was at. Leading an army of ten thousand into battle perhaps? Or sailing the seas alongside my unflinching, undaunted crew.
Adventures of perilous journeys and triumphant outcomes to satisfy any young heart. Or perhaps I wasn't thinking at all, but instead simply taken by the endless sea of blue that silently rocked above my head. 
They call it ""maladaptive daydreaming,"" I say it's creativity. There's a difference. Maladaptive leads to a decrease in productivity whereas mine leads to an increase. I don't just want to visit my fantasy worlds, I want to live in them, feel them, taste them.

23980,A Bored Goblin's Journey to Pass Time,"The motto of a typical goblin can be summed with these three simple words:
Rape. Kill. Pillage.
Rinse and repeat. A constant cycle of simple-minded banditry and cruelty against the weak. Lacking the instincts and perception to do anything else, these lowly creatures exist solely as mere annoying pests towards society as a whole. To add insult to injury, their species is largely weak; mere ants to be stepped on in the lower echelons of monsters. 
Creatures who innately draw the hatred of other species while lacking the fear-factor to counter. 
A worthless bunch of scum.
How...boring.
Seeing his brethren around him grovel around the carcasses of a group of deceased adventurers, a certain goblin shook his head. Ever since he was born, he was greeted with the same sight over and over again. Whether it be a villager, a passing traveler, or some weak adventurer, he'd witness his species continually rape, kill, and pillage these humans repetitively. 
It was the same thing repeated everyday. It was so boring in the eyes of this goblin.
""I can't be doing this any longer! I'm out of here!""
With that declaration, the inspired goblin stood up and left right there and then. He didn't know where he would go next. He hardly knew what the world was like outside of his goblin tribe. He didn't even know why he suddenly came to that revelation after being driven by instinct all this time.
He just knew his life was boring and thought maybe a journey would help pass the time.

But you only managed a draw. Even if it was a thousand years ago, it is only a couple of generations for some demonkin. Still less than ten for elves and dwarves.-Us? We were slaves. But once we became free you at least let us be free. Not like how you chased the others until they had to hide.-What this has to do with the attacks? It's those you sealed that have come back now. You should have known that no spell lasts forever. But you even forgot about it all!While it was still mostly peaceful, in the student city of Rsinna, a youngster finds a collapsed girl with no memories. Quickly recovering her memories might be the only way the distant country of Enthrodtia has to find some clues to all this.

23991,Naruto - The last of the Chaos Clan,"War, death, and destruction were the three best words to describe the Warring States Era. One clan in particular, the Chaos clan, took those three words as gospel and they too became one of the many clans to turn killing into an art.
