Constructive criticism is appreciated.

Hello, everyone! Do you enjoy urban fantasy action, adventure and battle in the vein of A Certain Magical Index and Fate/Stay Night? Do you want to see magi, vampires, and all manner of otherworldly badasses clash both in the open and behind closed doors? If you do, I present to you: Storia!  If you enjoy Brandon Sanderson's intricate and comprehensive magic systems, or Patrick Rothfuss's beautiful prose, or Stephen King's facility with language, or Max Gladstone's use of fantastic elements as a means of explaining the invisible forces that move the real world, well... I am not any of those authors. I am, however, deeply inspired and influenced by their work, and strive to approach their level of writing. I hope you give Storia a try, and do let me know what you think!",13
