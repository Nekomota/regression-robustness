I don't claim the MC of my story to be not cliched. With so many stories on the internet right now, It's almost impossible if not outright impossible to make an original MC. The best I can do is pick the kind of cliched MC I like the most and give it a twist of my own.

12025,Pandora,"A girl who grew to become a legend.
 

Okay yeah just made that synopsis up now... anyways, this book is BASED on Pandora's Box, but is not at all the actual story. This is me mixing and matching Greek mythology together in a weird way... with other stuff that has yet to be revealed.
Some facts/parts about the Greek society at the time may be incorrect and while I do try my best to make sure all are good there may be some that slip through the cracks, if something seems incorrect then please inform me.
That said, this is also not historically accurate either, while I will try my best to ensure the societal factors are correct the historical factors such as certain characters and places may not be accurate, if you believe there's a historical factor that wasn't intentionally done incorrectly then please inform me.

Current status: Developing it.

12041,The Twin Souled Dungeon,"When a God creates a Dungeon to further his plans in the Mortal Realm, little does he know that he has managed to find the tattered remains of two of the most stubborn souls in existence to create his dungeon's core. 
And due to him leaving the dungeon to grow whilst other plans are also put into motion, it is hardly unexpected that his plans regarding the dungeon don't quite go according to plan. 
Other plans are also set into motion as the dungeon is discovered much earlier than expected. 
A rather unusual Orc has decided that it has been too long that his people have been relegated to be the uneducated savages, forced to live in the barren Goldstein Mountains, and perhaps a certain dungeon is the perfect tool to help his people start jogging on The Path of Ancients, rather than the pitiful limping they have been doing.

Dwarfs? Once they were part of the great alliance. They helped build this very academy. But they were so stubborn, so unyielding, so unwilling to bend themselves to the rules. And so they weakened, and so they declined, and so their empires faded. What few that are left shun the academy. We have no dwarfs here.
Rogues? Perhaps a handful in the sprawl, hiding in the shadows, hoarding their merits, hoping to buy a promotion to something remotely useful, ninja or assassin perhaps. But in the academy proper? No. We have no rogues here.
And yet despite everything here she stands. Nala Greyward, Dwarf Rogue. Pettiest of thieves. Unpleasantest of surprises. Causer of problems.
So she killed an ogre. So nobody knows how she did it. So what. Throw her in with the real prospects, with the elves and the vampires and the fighters and the magic users. See how she does in that environment--see just how long it is, before the problem that is Nala Greyward solves itself.
This is Bright Battle Academy.

There is a system in place reminiscent of old school games based on levels and stats. These 54 have each been given a card from a deck. The card given is how strong you start off. Aces are the strongest, so those four chosen will be ridiculously overpowered right off the bat. Twos are the weakest, so they will be ridiculously underpowered. All will grow faster than any other beings in the world. Jokers however, they are wildcards. No one, not even the God of this game knows what they will start as or end up as. Only thing that can be noted of jokers is they have a completely unique skill, and don't have a destiny in place.
Whiskey, an army soldier's bastard kid that was left in the warzone of Iraq, is one of these chosen 54. With a checkered past full of grief and heartache as well as pain and despair, he has never been able to let loose with all the governments in place on Earth.

Plants, animals, humans and humanoids, magical beasts, monstrous existences and even minerals and ores accumulate mana throughout their natural lifespans/permeated existence and gradually create physical manifestations of the ""world's breath"" in the form of Mana/Soul stones.  A cataclysmic war from 500 years in the past had left deep scars in the world, extinguishing the history of noble kingdoms that formerly ruled much of the lands in peace and led to the loss of many great technologies and a long period of imbalance for years to come.   But before the fall of the greatest of these kingdoms, a prophecy was left for all to heed. ""Beware! A Herald will come to sound the advent of a new age. By sword, by magic and by wisdom, the world will be plunged into another great war that shall stain it in the blood of millions before returning it to its former glory.""  Weeks after the beacon signalling the arrival of the ""Herald"", a small band of individuals led by an alchemist who calls himself ""Will"" saves a village from the onslaught of a dragon, defeats a nationally acclaimed warrior in a duel and performs a feat of magic deemed impossible by the mages of the current times.   Is he the prophesied Herald? Will he put the world to the torch or will safeguard the future of life after the fated fall?

Marcus has played any number of VR games, beta-tested dangerous and unstable systems and lived to tell the tale. He even has a certain amount of fame and influence within...certain circles. He usually disdains the idea of pre-orders and their respective ""perks"" as blatent commerical exploitation, but this time the bonus is too tempting to pass up. The ability to craft your character's backstory and have it integrated into the game's lore is enough for him to sign up for the Early Access program. He isn't interested in being all-powerful. Frankly, he's been there and done that enough to be bored of the whole thing. Instead, he opts to make a character purely for the purpose of having fun. Things aren't quite what they seem however, and his ""backstory"" and character class have implications he never would have imagined.

Trial by Fire (Archemi Online Book #2) is the sequel to Dragon Seed, the first book in the Archemi Online LitRPG/Gamelit series. It is largely standalone, but I highly recommend reading Dragon Seed first!
One man. One game. One adorable baby dragon.
Two weeks ago, Hector Park cheated death by uploading his mind to the ultra-immersive fantasy RPG game, Archemi. After exposing the rotten heart of an order of dragon knights, he’s now on the run with a young queen dragon who could one day become the most powerful mount in the game.
To get strong enough to face their enemies, they need a quest – a big one. Fortunately, trouble has a way of finding Hector, and it does – in the form of a series of brutally murdered priests, a king in desperate need of a hero, and a beautiful, fiery berserker. The risk? Huge. The payoff? More gold than a dragon’s hoard.
There's only one problem - Archemi is haunted by the ghost of a mad developer bent on making the game his personal playground. And now that the world outside has vanished in a storm of nuclear fire, there's no one left to stop him. Or at least, that’s what he thinks. Because Hector isn't the kind of man to take this shit lying down, and neither is his dragon.

Plus, there's always something to do. Scheduling makes sure no one has a moment to be bored. Empaths are special, so none of the human staff mind putting the work in. People get moved around sometimes, depending on how old they are. It's sad to be separated from friends, but it makes sense. No point housing little kids with women, or older boys. Sometimes you might miss someone. It's okay, though. You still see your old friends sometimes; and the Institute is better than outside. Outside, people hurt empaths. That's why the Intstitute has so many guards.

Ed, was a normal man in a world full of superheroes, so he didn't really have too many complaints when that first truck fell on him. After all he'd read enough comics to know that sometimes things just happen. Besides he'd been getting on in years when it happened, and his life till then, though lonely, had more or less been fully lived. 
The second time around when that one guy pushed him off a cliff for a chalice of immortal ambrosia, wasn't so cool though, and then there was that third time when he was just getting used to life as a lady, and that crazy goddess showed up out of nowhere and started ranting about purging the demon menace....then some other stuff happened and he briefly got to go back to earth before falling into a coma where he adventured in the world of dreams. 
Then the aliens came, and the dream ended and he was suddenly stuck being the AI Overmind for the whole damn star systm. The aliens died, and because he was all mechanical and what-not he just kind of had to keep on going. 
Forced to continue collecting the materials and data from countless worlds that were destoryed in the process.  
Then there was that whole war with the gods business that followed...mostly because of all that world destroying he did because of some fairly faulty programming.
Anyway, thankfully someone pulled a ""rocks fall"" on that whole curfuffle, because by the time he was in control of himself again, things had long gotten out of hand. 
Now the powers-that-be tell him that he must spend the rest of his existence in single lonely section of the cosmos. Trapped in a single portion of a single universe. And now he weeps...No worries though, these are tears of joy. 
 
Hopefully this final unending existence he's been given will be the quiet life he's been looking for. 
 

A Man who's seen everything gets abducted by aliens and is converted into an AI that sits at the helm of a fleet of alien ships and behind the computer systems for most their planets.

12253,Legends of The Wesh: Lochley,"The Universe is held together by something. It is an undisputable truth but nobody knows what that something is. 
People claim that it is connected by The Path of Legends, where Gods traversed trying to find the meaning of their own existence. Others claim that the universe is a Tree, connecting worlds with its extending branches and giving life-bearing fruits to its inhabitants. Several even claimed that the Universe is just a colony of ants, that this universe and the worlds in it are just as insignificant as insects. 
In one of the Worlds in it, the arrival of someone signaled great changes. Gods will die, Trees will Rot, Insects will burn. Those at the top had fallen and they will upend the worlds trying to claim what was theirs. Those at the bottom have had enough of scraps and they yearned to devour the fruits of the worlds. Those that were innocent and caught in between had no choice but to persist, lest they get erased by the surging tides.
Nobody knows where will they end, but everybody knew where they started. They will not be judged, they will not be rebuked, they will not be curbed, they will not be vanquished.
The universe is their canvas and it’s time — time to paint their truths upon it.

Azrael was born as a prince in the warring world of Ost. Inheriting the title but not its privileges and oppressed by his siblings in every step of his life, he had no choice but to be subservient to their whims until circumstances spiraled him to the abyss, to a new world, and to more agreeable companions.
But is he truly free from the past or will it continue to hound him to his new life?

Elira had one wish… to be known more than as an offspring of the Great Phasol Family. Talented, hardworking, and stubborn, she struggled to break free from the influence of her family.
Everything had been going well in her life but is she strong enough to resist the upheaval and truths of the world?

William grew up in an orphanage with nothing to his name. Regaled by various tales of fantasy and greatness by his caretakers, he reached adulthood with the goal of having a legend of his own.
Will he make his mark on the world or be forgotten like an ant; crushed by the boot of an unsuspecting traveler.

The world of Lochley has been at peace for centuries and its undercurrents are growing restless from waiting… waiting for that spark of opportunity to ignite and swallow the world whole.
Some will cause it, some will resist it, and some be drowned by it.

In times long past, it had risen to a golden age of hero and myth, as humanity valiantly waged a war against demonkind until they were beaten back to the very edges of existence.

12293,A Merchants Tale,"Legends rise.
 
Country’s fall.
 
Empires wage war.
 
But what supports these great powers, allowing them to function as a single organism.
 
Is it the common man, Farmers and Millers forming the backbone of the land?
 
The Soldiers and Guards keeping public order?
 
The Wives and Widows supporting from the side-lines?
 
The Nobles from their seats of power?
 
Or the elusive Sorcerers who wield power untold?
 
And what maggots crawl in this great creature, all trying to get a piece of its slowly decaying flesh.
 
The gangs of the Underworld hidden in the shadows?
 
The Bandits and Deserters hiding at the edges, ready to pounce on any weakness?
 
Witches and Warlocks working their dark art?
 
Or other Nations clawing at their neighbour’s, salivating over the riches they stand to gain from another’s demise.
 
There is one group that belongs to neither group. They thrive on others misfortune and bring with them salvation and destruction in equal measure. They can raise a kingdom up or tear it down screaming and kicking.
 
These are the merchants, the lifeblood of kingdoms, because what is the one thing above all else men crave.
 
Is it Love? Power? Destruction?
 
All these things can be acquired with one simple thing.
 
Wealth.
 
Wealth is the true power behind the world. Wealth can buy army’s, strangle kingdoms, and turn even the most devout man from his faith.
 
Merchants come in many forms, shapes and sized, some gaudy, bleeding the people for all their worth, some tricky, preferring to make contracts and debts to trap men. And some desperate, doing all they can to sell even the most worthless of junk.
 
This is a story of one merchant who goes against all a merchant stands for. He works not for profit but for some unseen goal, a prophesy aeons old. He comes and goes like a ghost, bringing with him hope and victory. All pray for his arrival to spare them from despair. 
 
But what about when he doesn’t show? What about the people he doesn’t save?
 
For this man is no angel, no saint sent to save the masses. His goal was never to deliver hope. It merely isn’t time for their destruction yet.
 
For nothing is eternal.
 
And all things must end.
 
But what comes after?

She's never been one for reading fiction, or anything for that matter, but this feels like something straight out of a fantasy. Her newly acquired instincts, however, scream dungeon core. Whatever that is. Unlike most dungeon cores, though, she's missing something very important. A dungeon. Stuck out in the open, above ground where she's definitely not supposed to be, with not a cave in sight, or any other land form besides miles and miles of ice and snow, Devin's not sure if she can survive.
Update: Big caveate, though, just so you know. Started with this one idea and ran with it as far as I could. Characters and plot suffer from it, but I'm proud that I wrote as much as I did. I will rewrite this at some point and make it so it actually has plot.

As an author, I draw inspiration from other people's works, my bored imagination or even just random events. I have read many books, fictions, novels or whatever you wanna call them. This has led me to create a rather... not necessarily original, but at least uncommon point of view.
Things like believing that good and evil are the two sides of a coin and that love is in fact only a phenomenon created by hormones and is in fact, not a real emotion.
In case you haven't guessed it, this whole fiction is focused on philosophy. Why is being 'alone' a bad thing? I intend to target topics which people tend to discuss as being either 'good' or 'bad'. Take romance for example (or worst, genderbender), people have been fighting for centuries over wether it's a funny, sad, good or bad topic. 
So yeah... Don't expect to enjoy this, but if you're a masochist like myself and you enjoy reading philosophy mixed with grinding, then have fun~!",8

The story will follow close to the games stories (as best as i remember some of them) however there will be some slight to severe alterations as the pokemon world lacks a bit of common sence that would apply to anyworld. As the story goes on regions will change and new pokemon exclusive to those regions will appear like the game.
-------------
Hey everyone this is my first novel and a random idea that came to me while i was reading a reincarnation novel here on RR and i was playing a pokemon game on the side and it kinda came to me. l will have polls occasionally to see how people want things to go down or what possible direction to go.
Now a couple warnings the first being grammer. I'm not the best at gramer so if bad grammer triggers you in some way its best to just not bother. Second warning and most important is that this is a more mature take on pokemon. Seriously if you grew up with pokemon like me you probably would like some mature pokemon story. So there will be profanity here in there. Not going to see people cursing up a storm except maybe one of the teams. Especialy team skull they got the whole sterotype going. Gore.... honostly not sure if im going to have detailed pokemon death or just have the normal fainting and any death will be in the background or be hinted at. There will be sexual content but im going to have those in side chapters so people who don't care for them can just skip them.",739

Lys Ravenlicht was no hero, nor was he a brave man. He was someone who had the better things in life and figured that he'd tread upon the path his late father had prepared for him as an appointed noble and a politician in his home country and he had no business whatsoever of being a hero. And yet, it took only one twist, one twist of fate, before all plans he had laid out for the rest of his life went down the tubes.
Join him as he traverse the lands of Fymia, where the arcane had faded into the annals of time and yet persist in the most mundane of things. And as he found himself dragged deeper into a catastrophic series of events that would change his perception of the world, and the course of history for the world itself...

Only a sane person with the right mind would do that. Having to acquire something before an inevitable and hopeless end is the best option rather than trying to find the solution for the end of the world. I mean, the device used to re-seal the Demon Lord is gone. It could be under the ocean for all we know so why waste you're energy on stupid things like that?
Of course, why would I waste my energy to do my incredibly hard goal when I can have my fellow party members to do it.
Saving their ""lives"" from lesser goblins using a stick as a weapon usually does the trick to get someone on board so I think I'm pretty much set.

She must grow, and learn of this strange new world.Twilight Arc (Ongoing)Liara makes a place of herself in the world and learns of Arcania and what will happen if she does not intervene.Author's NoteWhat you can expect from this storyThis novel is my take on the resurrection theme. I wanted to write a resurrection story with every element I liked about the theme, but without the elements I disliked. This is the story of Liara. MC's second go at life in a world where magic is real.Arcania is not a nice place. It is my answer to the question ""How would civilizations develop if powerful magic was real and widespread enough."" I try hard to make a large consistent story in a large consistent world. There will be lots of characters and organizations built to various levels of depth. The story starts small and grows in size and scope.I try to avoid plot armor as much as I can. You can expect at least MC to make it alive quite far in the story. It's the MC's story after all.I spent time building the world before beginning with the writing itself. How continents are shaped, the evolutionary history of the species, the history of the world, the structure of the solar system, the rules of magic, etc... I have planned the whole overarching plot. I have a clear ending in mind.There will be lots of battles and action. From large scale magic battles between immensely powerful beings to small skirmishes. Expect fights to be bloody. In Arcania, magic is just another set of law of physics. It's a natural phenomenon with clear rules to it. Gods exists, they are absolute being that see humanity like a human would see an ant. They are not just really powerful individuals. They act rarely, and indirectly.What this story will not beThere will be no harem element and little to no romance or sex in this story.There will be some comedy and comic relief, but Arcania in general is not a nice place.Fights will be bloody, but I won't write gory descriptions.",271

And so… here I am talking to a relic of a past… talking to a device akin to a video recorder… okay… here I go… 
I… am a reincarnator.
I died at the most happy day of my life… on the day I was going to be married (20 y/o). Well although I still have some regrets it was already in the past so there’s nothing I can do since I already reincarnated in this world. 
Let me tell you this… the life of a reincarnated is no sugar and rainbow, I would have died a thousand times over if I were careless, I got no cheat power from god and I was born on a family of adventurers, it’s an ordinary family that you can find anywhere in this world. Although in the end I was known as the Black  Avenger the strongest in the guild it was not because of god or convenient plot device, no… I worked my ass off throughout most of my life! I envy those OP MC that got their powers from god and some kinda plot device!! God I hate them!!!
 Fuu…fuu… calm down… I certainly spent 20 years of my life struggling and honing my skills to survive, and it’s worth it I don’t regret it even for one bit. 
The thing is I want to talk about my past in details but… maybe next time.
Okay! Enough gloomy talk and move on the the problem I’m currently facing, Currently I am living with a 11 years old girl… No kidding! A guy in mid twenties living with a cute little girl! And no I am not a lolicon. This little girl hired me for a certain job and because of some circumstances I have no choice but to take care of her. I wonder what will happen from now on? I hope everything is going to be okay… Oh she’s calling me maybe she’s hungry?”

    This is an adventure story in which the main protagonists are a group of five children who are close friends. The world has been invaded by a group of immortal evil being. A good immortal being enlists the five friends to engage the evil invaders in.. At stake is the fate of the human race. The story does not contain profanity, sex and gore, since it is intended to provide wholesome entertainment for children and adults, particularly those who are young at heart. 
 
                                                              Prologue
     It was a dark night when the greatest evil being of the universe landed on a remote mountain peak in Peru bringing his four assistants whom he addressed as Number One, Two, Three and Four. They in turn called him as the Boss. On landing on terra firma they all assumed human shape. The Boss had considerable magical powers, could travel billions of light years in the blink of an eyelid, and all five of them were immortal.
     They went about their task of enslaving the human race by using their magical powers to control the minds of many people from the surrounding area and arming them with magical guns. Soon South America was under their absolute control and they were preparing to conquer the whole world. This would have dire consequences for the human race. The Boss would gradually drain the mental energy of all human beings till they were reduced to the level of animals. Then he would travel with his assistants to some other planet harboring intelligent life and repeat the same process there.
     Fortunately, the greatest good being of the universe arrived on the earth to thwart their evil intentions. He also acquired human shape and called itself the Chimp because of a slight resemblance to that creature. Since the laws of nature did not permit direct conflict between these two great beings, the Chimp searched for suitable humans to battle against the evil invaders.
     After considerable effort, he decided that a group of five young American children from the small town of South Bend were best suited for this purpose. Their leader was Peter Edwards, a boy with a well rounded personality and a flair for computers. The others were his close friends Anthony Sebastian, Monique Danville, Mathew Rossi, and Roger Steinberg. All of them were very brave and highly talented. One night the Chimp appeared mysteriously in Peterâ€™s bedroom to enlist him and his friends.",6

12643,The Soul Binder an Expansion Story,"Welcome to the 15th expansion of Earth!
 
After the Modern World expansion we realized there was no true goal for the players, and the unbalance of certain weapons using gunpowder. We have chosen to get rid of gunpowder as it goes away from a skill based system letting weaker members take down stronger ones through luck. Reverting back to simpler systems was a hard choice for us, but I do believe this will provide you with a more satified experience.
 
Due to people having to relearn a lot of things, we have icreased the first year's skill advancement system, and have used the life of everyone under the age of ten to revert all of the current players back to ten.

In the times of the Forefathers, when wars were waged, villages were pillaged and innocents were murdered, the lost souls fought against the injustice that befell them. Only after the continuous pleading for a new chance, the Gods decided to be lenient: They gifted them one opportunity. One pathway to lead them to the life they were once robbed. 
Those, whose desire to get back to the living was strong enough could recover a part of their soul, turning them to beings between the living and the dead. Beings with the embers of a new life inside of them. Beings whose eventual purpose will turn into solely trying reclaiming their past.
With rekindling their souls, they earn the right to venture out of the ever sleeping lands of the dead, stepping a foot into the Lost Kingdom, where they try to climb the Tower of Gods.

Hello, Author here! I am, unfortunately, rather terrible at coming up with descriptions that seem to have the right amount of decorum and yet actually serve their function of adequately describing the story, so here's the coursenotes.
- The story follows a fire elemental. (As you can tell from that, it is heavily besed on fantasy with mages and the like. Technology will not feature prominently)
-As mentioned in the tags, this will have game-like aspects. (E.G. levels, stats. I will be trying to put my own twist on this notion however, so bear with me if the premise intrests you but you despise LitRpg)
-It'll get rather dark, but not devastatingly so. (I'm trying to write a more complex story so it will have its dark moments, the prologue being one of them. Rest assured the whole story will not be this dark, though I'll make sure that no-one is a saint either)
-The protagonist/protagonists will not be a Mary-Sue. (The plural will be understood when I'm further into the story. They also won't be impossiby unlikeable such as those in many Light novels.)
-There is no prophecy (Anyone who says there is, is lying, trust me.)",71

Destiny
Noun. the hidden power believed to control what will happen in the future; fate.
 
I never believed in such things.
 
People use destiny as an excuse to push responsibility onto a hero. There is no predetermined hero, just someone who happened to be in the right place, at the right time. 
 
Ironic as it may be, I was the person who happened to be in the right place, at the right time. But there is one last thing that completes destiny, and that’s the action a hero takes to change the future.
 
I’ve already completed steps 1 and 2 in the process of fate without my knowledge, so I might as well use the 3rd step to my advantage. 
 
This is the story of changing the future to avoid destiny.

Anyway, Mary was her name and it stood for ‘love’ and ‘beloved’. But I grew up knowing the sides of ‘sea of bitterness’ and ‘rebelliousness’ that carved themselves on one side of the same coin to her name.

Thus, there begins my story; the story of a man who had found himself in a world that could only be described as the fabled ‘Alternate Reality'. In my previous world, due to a spiral of unfortunate events- some of which were admittedly of my own creation- I tragically met my end. By the time I had somehow regained consciousness, I found myself inhabiting the body of a foreign eight-year-old girl with all the memories of my previous life intact.
This world, which I have since dubbed ‘Timeline B’, has some very noticeable… ‘problematic’ differences from the world I had been familiar with. The level of technology and culture hadn’t deviated from the old world. That said, the structure of society had an awkwardly meshed in ‘Nobility’ system in an otherwise perfectly functional democratic government.

12878,Small Chests Are Fine Too,"It is an undeniable fact that good things come in small packages. More often than not, it is necessary to trim the fat in order to bring what really matters to the forefront. Having extra bulk may seem like a good idea, but in reality it is merely a crutch that will one day become a hindrance, as it is no substitute for personality nor ability. Indeed, often times it is the small things in life that brighten up our daily lives and constantly remind us exactly why we do the things we do.
However, it is important to keep an open mind, for while bigger is not always better, there are also times when it is. This holds especially true when it comes to hopes and dreams, which have been known to require a suitably large container from time to time. And while dreaming big could potentially lead to massive dissapointment, one will never truly reach fulfilment if they think too small.
A truth that one small woman with meager aspirations is about to find out.

Some people have just more potential than others, it seems. But to which do we owe this fact? Morbus Fortis, the Protagonist Syndrome, offers an explanation: It's genetics. Some people are simply born smarter, stronger and better-looking than others, but if that makes them any happier remains to be seen. Watashi wa eiy? ni naritaku ja nai explores the daily life of people who are just a cut above the rest - but choose not to act on what destiny has in stock for them. Being a hero is hard, unrewarding work and sometimes you just want to be like everyone else. Join these reluctant heroes, as they try to be anything but.

The MC was playing online games with his friend when he brought up the disappointment of the unforeseen long hiatus that his favorite light novel has been in right at the climax of the story! The MC sighs saying that it has been three years with no signs of the author picking up his pen to continue the story.  The MC recalls the heroics of the fictitious gaming character when he boldly declared to his friend, “If I was that hero I would be able to defeat you at any game!  Even if you were my friend I would make you cry defeat a thousand times at least!”
Unknowingly that those words would make his friend be playful and changing the MC’s life forever.
How his friend would put it “that MC would have had an ordinary life, but that would have been boring”.

Badass Men of the One Million Realms Unite!
A murderous duo of badasses, bound by the spilling of blood and seared in the fiery infernos of battle, angrily part company in search of man’s ultimate holy grail, The Fountain of Testosterone. Rick Durenor, a stoic mercenary, lives up to his nom de guerre– Ultra Death Graveman, while his former partner and kinda-but-not-really friend, Heart Tearer Outer, seeks revenge for a perceived slight that launches both men down a path that neither may return from.
The quest is noble; a crusade intended for only the manliest of men, set against the backdrop of evildoers, men with spiders for heads, crazy dudes with buzzsaws for arms, and those are the nicer guys! Allegiances are never sure on the road to absolute testosterone driven power. Just as Graveman forms a band of fierce followers, doubts are raised and trusts are questioned. The bottom line in this fantasy, sci-fi adventure is ‘cover your own ass’ – death is coming, and it's probably yours.
Lock and load, raise those fists and move over, bitch: Xtreme Force punts pussies to the curb and dispatches an all-out assault to deliver death, screaming, disgusting misogyny, and virile, ultra-erect audacity. Don't listen to your mom when she tells you to clean your awesome room, don't say ""excuse me"" when you leave the dinner table, and brush your teeth only once a day. This is the way of men.
Will our badass heroes reach the legendary FOUNTAIN OF TESTOSTERONE, or will they DIE?! Hell fuckin' yeah they will. They'll die AND they'll reach the fountain, because both of those things are manly as fuck. You doubtin' these boys? Shit, kid; you're trippin'.
Oh yeah, and it's definitely not satire, so don't come in expecting social commentary or any other form of meaningful metaphorical dialouge, ya' nerd-ass-dork-butt-wiener-face.

12974,The Development,"My name is Lu J King, everyone calls me by my nickname LuJay. I got a message one day tell me that I would be abducted off the planet, asking me what super powers and magic I wanted in a multiple choice format while also telling me to simultaneously to fuck off. At times, the choices gave me hope, and other times it would get me into so much trouble. I’m not an emo, but this emotional rollercoaster wasn’t something I was expecting. I don’t miss home, I ruined my own family because of my own greed. I had everything I ever wanted, then one day I lost it all and became a hermit on Earth.

12976,Being chased by the heroes because I am a Master Puppeteer.,"Even though it wasn't bad, she hoped that her ability was more combat like heroes' ability. But what she didn't know after she wished that, she became a Master Puppeteer and turned the Demon King into her puppet collection. With that being said, she was forced to run away because of her stupid lucks.
Her title was ?Outsider? that forced her to leave the kingdom after 30 days she was summoned into the another world. Her job class was a?Puppeteer? that was based on her hobby. Her body went through a tremendous change and she who was a mid age woman with 180 cm tall became a loli with white hair because of the frequent mana explosion she caused. Since it has been like that, she decided to be positive and became a gothic lolita that she couldn't be in the past. 
And at the end of the day [not exactly], she was chased by the divine heroes because of the Demon King that she has subdued.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Read this before reviewing.
You can gave me a review and be savage about anything including grammar. But, just fyi. I'm only doing this for fun and have no intention on becoming pro. I just wrote because I wanted to read such a genre and plots because of the lacks of the novel of the similar genre and plots. Ah, but about my grammar... Even if you asked me to do something about it, it wasn't extremely bad plus I didn't have grammar editor, so I can't do anything about it.",102
12977,A Forbidden Contract,"The year is 2078, as technology advances the world is eventually autonomous with no one needing to work. VR Gaming is the most popular entertainment in the world. Our 'Hero', Greg, sets out to play one of the newest games; The game known as Conquest: A Time Of Need. It is pictured as one of the best games of magic and swordplay.
'As the world stabilizes will you become a Tyrant King, or even a Court Wizard? Only those brave enough can control the future.'
Greg wants to just be a decent living being, but can he stay out of all the conflicts going on in the game?

Feel free to give me any criticism or suggestions for the future.",21
12978,Out of the Blue,"Spring: the chrips of the birds, the blooming of the flowers, and the gentle patter of the rain. Ah, what a beautiful time of the year! When students look forward to the coming summer vacation, when lovers rejoice under the sprouting trees, and when monsters rampage across the planet, but of course this would be autumn in the southern hemisphere.
Thus is the peaceful life of our protagonist shattered as game like elements and otherworldly denizens intrude upon an unsuspecting Earth. Armed with nothing but his modern sensibilities and urban constitution, he will have to face a world brimming with encounters - both monstrous and otherwise.

For those who are confused, this is one of those RPG Apocalypse stories.",122

12982,My Mythical Odyssey,"Lost in a mythical forest as a soul with no thought or mind, our MC bumps into a mysterious man who, seemingly pleased with our MC, gives him a second chance at life. The soul of our MC turned into an egg then born as a white wisp wakes up in a strange forest with very little memories of a past life that seems so distant and far. As our MC starts his journey what strange encounters will he come upon and what destined meetings will he have?",8
12988,The Orderly Powergame (Dodeca's Short Stories),"These are short stories, but they take place in the same universe following the same time line. This is a line of events of a powergame and its effects. Each chapter has a new perspective, no perspective is repeated. Thus every character whether main or background only gets one chapter.
Since I realized that I really like making short stories, I thought I would make a collection of them at one place instead of just spamming standalone fictions onto the website and having about seperate 121 fictions in a year when they're only just short stories ranging from 400-2000 words. If you're into short stories, drama, the harsh yet sweet part of reality and really, really like watching people suffer, then boy do I have the short stories for you!",1
12990,The New Trimension,"Ok this is my second time writing all of this sorry if anything is spelled wrong or just rushed but I was little angry I had to write it again. After all the words just disappearedHave you ever wondered what the definition of evil is I have. I never actually saw something as being evil. I actually believe there is no such thing as evil. I'll give you an example of what people call evil . If I walked into a bank pulled out a gun and said give me the money would be labeled as evil or bad. But If I a cop walked in and shot me he would be labeled as a Good
The way I see is that there is no such thing as evil or god there is only what man perceives as evil or good. Well sorry for the lecture but this story is about me so I can can talk however I want really. Ok you may be asking what this story is about well this story is about how I became the harbinger of evil the bringer of destruction The killer of millions ect there's a lot of nicknames. I'm gonna write a book about how I rose up In power well actually my freind dj is gonna write it but whatever .... Ok well the years 2056. We have flying cars and other things. All the cool crap. My real name is stax. As of right now let's skip some details up until we get to the real story . Basically I'm playing a virtual reality game call The New Trimension. Or T.N.T for short .
This is a fairly new game it's set in a different dimension where people actually have super powers you can play as a super villain or good guy you can be a while lot of different races there's a lot of things you can do well I'll just explain everything once you get into the story see you there hopefully lol.",2
12992,The legend who ran faster than the gods,"Life is filled with twists and turns and however dull it may seem to you, it becomes a story to another. Follow our protagonist as she finds her feet in her dark magical medieval world, and discovers the hidden beauty to life, making unexpected friends through fate and fortune, misery and terror, adventures and hardships. While this story attempts to bring out unique flavours and ideas, it lightly touches on a few traditional tropes with a refreshing breeze. This is a story of a girl's chaotic journey through life as she makes lifelong friends, growing up physically, magically and emotionally, and eventually comes to discovers her talent-to run fast, faster then anyone in recorded history.
Author's note: Although I've written (and not posted anywhere) several stories, this is my first story where I have really felt come out brilliantly plot wise (you be the judge) and posted (so far). I'm still new to the literary industry so I hope to recieve much feedback, and will attempt to incorparate any valuable feedback I receive. Depending on my writing pace for this series (I want to keep the quality relatively high) , I may release a second series which is also a historical fantasy (funny enough) that goes around breaking the fourth wall, being funny, while attempting to break cliches and surprise the audience.
P.S. Sorry if my naming scheme is cringy...not very good at naming things... Tags may also be unreliable. The prologue as a whole may not be a good representation for the story, so don't judge a book by its cover-although the cover is pretty good. The story starts off a bit dark, but it gets less dark further on...at least that's what's planned. Also, bonus points if you can see the hidden object in the cover and comment what it is. It was photoshopped into the cover with 15% transperency. There are also some typos in earlier chapters that I haven't gotten around to fixing...please bear with it. If you want a better judge of the series, read one of my later/recent chapters. They're quite a bit better.",106
12993,A little bit of Villainy,"Our world has become an apocalyptic wasteland where the only law is that of the strongest. In this nightmare, a band heroes rise up to save the remnants of humanity from itself.They build a great city to shelter the weak, only for the city (and all its inhabitants) to get blown to pieces by what many would call a villain.  
All the heroes die in the explosion but the goddesses of light and order transport their souls to a fantasy universe where they need to vanquish the demons and save humanity. The heroes succeed and 'peace' returns. These acts left the goddess of Chaos dying and as you all know desperate times call for desperate measures. 
""The only thing that can defeat a hero is a villain and luckily I know where to find one, one that has already killed them once."" , -The goddess of chaos
The Villain that once bested the heroes gets revived as a Dracolich, an undead dragon of great power, and brings with him a storm a Chaos and Fun.
""I can't really say I won against them in our last life since we all ended dying in that explosion, but this time I'm gonna win our fun little rematch.""- Villain 

This story is about a Villain who just wants to have a good time and maybe create a little mayhem.
Note: I know I tagged this story with an anti-hero lead tag, but that is only because there is no tag called villain lead.",31

""Let's help them !"" they said.
""Let's play a game !"" they said.
If the rumbling of the sea wasn't enough to make me think that something bad was going to happen, the deep masculine voice who resonated everywhere in the world completely steeled my doubts : We are in deep shit.
