11001,An Un-Ideal Eternity,"An Un-Ideal Eternity is about a man named Desmond, who is killed, revived, and then finds himself immortal in a post-apocalyptic society. Just because it’s a society doesn’t mean that either he or “they” have to be civilized. And just because a gentleman has become immortal does not mean that he has no dangers to be wary of.
The good news is that he’s been afforded some very kind and very generous ministrations from his future-self. The bad news is that all those efforts might still not be enough, to allow our hero, to live in as untroubled and as un-tumultuous a manner as he’d prefer.",192

11003,Twisting Fate (Complete),"Through the planes another world lies, fighting for survival from the taint their ancestors unleashed on their world. For generations, they have called beings from other planes to bolster their forces, but now few answer their calls. So, they turn to what their ancestors did in desperation, the very thing that doomed them originally. Forcing a planar junction, so they may retreat there to fight against their enemies.
They turn to the plane their ancestors were thrown out of, a plane where magic is no longer. Earth, now a land of technological marvels unprepaired for both the demonic taint and the shattered kingoms of theirs. 
Adrian Ravnos a young man who wants little more than to have some fun playing games and reading books must survive in this world rapidly returning to the state his ancestors lived in, reality and fate in flux. Can he even survive let alone thrive in this twisted world?
As the plane of Althrá has been dragging beings of power to their plane for centuries there are multiple systems of both magical and physical arts known by characters within this story. Likewise, many ideas have been adopted and implemented by the dying deities of Althrá.
This story is being rewritten, it will stay up until the rewrite is done.",688
11004,Just A Simple Heist,"Once, Ren was the model citizen. Coming of age in the city of Leyden, built up around its famed academies, Ren reaped the benefits of an education afforded to few others. Despite the early death of his father, or perhaps because of it, he strove to make the best of said education. He particularly found success in the theatrical arts, coming to develop an uncanny talent for acting.
However, after being uprooted from his home by a twist of fate, Ren began to apply these talents in less… savory… pursuits. From basic thievery to elaborate con-acts, Ren cajoled his way from town to town, constantly pushing the boundaries of his abilities. So, after one too many notable close calls, Ren jumped at the chance for an easy job offered by an old contact from Leyden. After all, what could go wrong with just a simple heist?
 
A fair warning to all readers: This is my first real attempt at writing, well, anything. As such, I have no prior experience to inform a schedule on release timings. While, as an avid reader of novels on this site myself, I will do my best to keep up a steady pace of content, I can’t guarantee anything now. Additionally, if you enjoy the story (or don’t!) please let me know what works well and what doesn’t. I hope to do my best to learn as I go, and this will be made infinitely easier with feedback from you all!
Finally, while it’s possible there will be references to sexual content, owing to my lack of knowledge on how to write them, I will likely leave out anything explicit (hence the lack of the warning on the story).",1

11008,In this Dangerous World,"Walking home one evening after school, Devin was attacked by a monster straight out of a horror movie. Just as she thought she was going to be eaten alive, she was saved--if you can call it that--by something that could only be considered the bringer of the apocalypse, which swallows the first monster as a evening snack.
Unfortunately for Devin, this new apocalyptic horror considers her the main dish. In a desperate bid, Devin manages to escape, but finds herself in a strange, dangerous new world far from Earth. Now she must figure out how to survive when everything seems to want to eat her, all while feeling the threat of that ancient eldritch looming ever closer.

Hello, I go by the name DragonX here in rrl. This is my first story so I hope you forgive me for all the grammar and plot holes that I may make. This is also a chance for me to improve my English.
Anyways, as you can read, this will be a xianxia/xuanhuan novel. One thing for sure I'm not going to do is go apeshit on cultivation like Martial God Asura and Coiling Dragon where they can still cultivate even when they are immortal, instead I plan to do it more like TJSS work where immortality is the end of the cultivation.
Lastly, this novel will have lots of sex. It is important in the story but the sex scene will be put into side story marked with ""0.5"".

However, he did not die, but woke up in the hut of a legendary master in the world of martial arts, with missing memories.
What will happen with young Shin? Will he return home, back to being the weak target he always was, or will he rise above, and become strong like no other? Will he become the disciple of the legendary Master of martial arts, Shou Atsutaka?

This is my second work, which I'll be writing as I take a break from my other story. This is not a xianxia story, or anything like that, but a story about martial arts. It's heavily inspired by the anime/manga ""History's Strongest Disciple, Kenichi!""

11057,"Yes, I died. But that was millennium ago, okay!?","Synopsis: A synopsis to a fairy tale.
A thin book, previously lying on a table, suddenly danced in the air. No strings, no hands or any visible force affected it in any way, but as if disregarding gravity itself, it flew to a point, then levitated in place.
The front of the book depicted a hill-top scene, with moody weather out-shadowed by a figure in ragged clothes. A title outstretched above boldly said 'The Sixth Sage' in a blood-red font.
Upon whatever force affecting the book opening it, a small story was inscribed. Skipping the contents and the obligatory 'based on a true story', the invisible reader opened the first page of the story, reading as such:
'Prologue:
The was once a world, plunged into an abyss of abuse and corruption. Demons and devils conquered sentient mortals with the ruthless annihilation of any significant cultures, humans, elves... Even the Orcs weren't spared from such a merciless fate, but, for those left living, things became far worse.
Generations upon generations of these demonic scum enslaved such beings, each building closer to absolute dominance over their subjects, by any vile methods available. Unfed physical labour, beatings and a constant robbery of lives and possessions were daily occurrences, especially for the poor minors of the society.
'No members of a race are completely the same.'
This ironic lie was said to such lords who, after fulfilling their share of violence, dared to force their 'possessions' to have compassion.
However, in an unforeseen twist, such an exception lead to their downfall. Not a demon, a beast-kin whose mastery of the magical arts, perseverence and flames of revenge extinguished this oppressive empire, wiping them off the face of the planet. And in replacing it, brought freedom where none could fathom it.'

11063,Witch of Andania,"Laura Alexandra Muriel is the willful 16-year-old crown princess of the island kingdom of Andania. Endowed with breathtaking beauty and well-versed in both the twin arts of magic and the zither, she’s the gem of the imperial family.
However, the golden age of Andania is long past and the weakened nation is besieged by the northern protectorate of Vaishya and threatened by the southern slave empire of Saadian. As the flames of war ignite throughout the world and Andania teeters on the brink of destruction, the nation’s survival demands the ultimate sacrifice from one to save the many.

A civilization with two opposing systems of magic.
Ancient Magic: Wielded only by Andanian witches, emphasizes innate Talent and self-sacrifice for higher magic (Talismans, Song).
New Creation Magic: Preferred by the high gods & the rest of the world, requires sacrificing the life energy and blood of others for higher magic (Spells, Incantations & countless other forms).
 
A world with two antagonistic superpowers and an island nation forced to the brink of extinction.
Protectorate of Vaishya: The world’s largest trading union. Calcutta, the capital is the wealthiest city on earth, and ruled by the benevolent Zimran royal family, who seeks to establish a trading monopoly on unique Andanian magic.
Empire of Saadian: The world’s mightiest slave empire. Riyadh, the capital is the grandest city on earth, built on the backs of countless slaves, and ruled by the Immortal Emperor Xerxes, who seeks exclusive rights to the immense military potential of unique Andanian magic.
Andania: In its golden age, its unrivalled magical wares were famous throughout the known world. Magical artifacts with unimaginable power, flying fleets of steel, and enchantments that rivaled the divine blessings of gods.
But today. An aged powerless king clings on to power with his two young daughters, the last of the ancient witches of Andania. And as the fleets of both Vaishya & Saadian crest the horizon, the survival of the nation is threatened as never before.
 
And two princesses that simply wanted to spend a happy childhood together in peace.
Laura Alexandra Muriel: The willful & stubborn elder sister and The Witch of Andania, the title granted to the most accomplished witch of her generation. Her sworn duty, to sacrifice even her very life, to ensure the safety of her people. Her greatest love and lifelong competitor, her dearest younger twin sister.
Lily Alexandra Muriel: The kind & supportive younger sister and the undisputed genius in the zither and song. Her only wish, to live in peace and quiet with her elder twin. Her curse, a power that could doom an empire to desolation.
 
What’s the worst that could happen?
A forbidden Tower, that can grant any wish. A forgotten Species, resides within the darkest depths of the seas. An ancient Serpent, plots to usurp the remnants of the high gods.
Powerful witches, desperate wishes, lost memories. Immortal emperor, devious archmages, blood sacrifice. High gods, undead diviners, hidden costs.
Will the mortal witches finally triumph? Will the Immortal rule the world? Will the gods survive the serpent’s schemes?
And what about that cute fluffy kitten? Will she ever have her heart’s desire?

Edward Hillore.
He was a orphan that was a adopted by a sexy woman on her mid 20's while he was 16. Waht he didn't expected was that the woman was a highly trained professional assassin looking for an heir. the next 5 years were a mixture of hellish training and lovely breaks. What? A woman in her mid 20's with unsasctified sexual urges and a sixteen year old boy in puberty, what else did you expected? Anyway, after the 5 years of training they started doing jobs together.
That is, till that fated day where... Oh, whatever, long story short, they tried to do a bank heist and failed and thus decided to kill themselves to not get caught since they wouldn't be able to escape and due to a promise. And as a nasty last laugh they exploded the bank.
But what Ed didn't expected was what existed after death.

Here, they live in a world with experience and Levels, Classes and Skills, and they fight against monsters, training for years just to achieve a Level that can allow them to make a small difference.
Yet even with this training, it is not enough. The Crystal Adventurers are forced to retreat further and further every year as the Shadow of Life's monsters grow stronger and more numerous, destroying cities at an increasing rate. If the city of Maelnor falls, then it will be less than a year before nearly all of the Crystal Adventurers are wiped out, both those brought to the realm upon death, and those born and raised there.
Legends tell of a prophecy that describes a team led by the legendary child of the prophecy, a child whose destiny is not to end the Shadow of Life, but to act as a harbinger, one whose very existence will turn the tides of war, one who must meet three seemingly impossible or currently unheard of criteria before the tides truly change.
This is the tale of Team Noruva, which consists of a quiet, yet wise healer, a silent, but thoughtful rogue, a knight with an iron will, a wolf beastborn who gained access to the System, and their leader, who ignores the impossible and does whatever he wants, because why the hell not? This is the tale of their adventures and daily lives, their ups and downs, their struggles, successes, and losses.

Another world, not much unlike our own, with some exceptions, such as, say, the presence of gods, demons, and magic. While things like these will be forgotten after the Great Witch Hunt of the 1500's, let us turn the clock back to an earlier time. Back to an age of adventure and magic...
In the year of 1010 A.S. (Anno Salvator) a group of powerful magicians called the Stargazers, who had come together to create powerful new magic for the good of all mankind, had created an amazing, unique spell that no one had ever seen before: the Knighting. Using the power of one of the 366 Birth Stars, they could grant any human amazing magical power, turning them into what is known as a Magic Knight.
The young man known only as Grey was one of these Magic Knights. An orphan who was taken in by Emperor ?tori after the mysterious disaster at Dragon's Cradle in 1011 A.S., he now fights alongside other warriors for the continued peace of the Phoenix Empire.
Now, in 1018 A.S., Let us tell the story of one of the many tasks that Grey and his friends have been trusted with by the Emperor: taking a young priest on a pilgrimage to the Lunar Forest to offer thanks to the goddess of the moon.
Though, of course, if things were that simple, this wouldn't be a story worth telling, now, would it...?
Note: While this is set in the same world as Young Magic Knight, my previous work, it is not required reading in order to enjoy this, although it may help.

Authors Note/Important Message:
HELLO EVERYONE! I am I Can Spell! and I am now the author of this story. A LONG time before I made this account I was reading stories on Royal Road. During this time the very first story I ever got into was ""The Shattered Sword"" by Blovix. I loved this story but, like nearly every story on Royal Road (and inevitably probably this one), the author's release schedule was erratic and eventually stopped altogether.
My plan is to edit the previous chapters minorly and then take the story in the direction Blovix told me he wanted to since I think its pretty damn good. To be honest, I didn't expect him to have thought the story out all the way to the end since he stopped the story.
Anyway, I hope you all enjoy The Shattered Sword as much as I did.
Here is where Blovix proves I'm not lying.
https://royalroadl.com/fiction/chapter/126674
PS: It's called The Shattered Swordsman because it was what Blovix originally wanted to call it but mistyped and ended up never changing it but I like swordsman because the story is about Nathan, not his sword.",14

11174,Smokecutter,"The year was 2125. 
After planet earth was made uninhabitable by the great nuclear war, humanity sought a home anywhere else on the horizon of its reach. Pharavanna, in the Andromeda galaxy, was the only home accessible by human space travel. The surviving factions claimed the planet, the most powerful being the Mega Corporation known as Nexactus.
Meanwhile, on the planet's surface, a bold defector sought to bring change to the conflicted world around him. Nexactus left the people outside the faction in shambles, and anyone that opposed the corporation would face certain doom. This defector defied the corporation, choosing to help those who had been hurt by its power and corruption.

11180,Paradox,"If given the choice to be able to travel through time upon your death, many people would immediately jump at such an opportunity. However, there is one person, a hero, who detests this power. If only he could die, if only he could end the cycle, if only he could travel back to the time he got his power and never get it in the first place, if only he didn't have things that were worth enduring this torment for. 
If only I wasn't the one chosen to burden such an unfair destiny.

AN: So, this is gonna be my first try using a different writing style. I usually write in the third person (I think?) like with The Lone Wanderer, but I'm gonna try the first person with this one.
Also, this is a teaser chapter and a placeholder. Don't expect regular updates at all since I'm focusing on my current main novel, The Lone Wanderer.

Or fight along with your comrades and survive through the support of friends? Everything was just for staying alive. Until you find the secret of God's Dimension. Who is the real enemy?

I will not be doing the ""classic"" type of Terror Infinity (Manga type dialogue, harem concentrated, flat characters, horrible grammer (though mine is not the best either), and etc.) If thats what you are looking for, might as well stop reading. This will losely be based on Terror Infinity, but in a novel format and with a wider plot. This is my first attempt at writing a story so this will be a work in progress.

But as they dwelled deeper, forbidden knowledge was found, for humanity found the way to upset the balance between life and death, to mock God's very own will, to bring those that had died back to the land of living.
A taboo was made, a dark stench left on mankind's history, one that even years after is still being broken, but such an open act of heresy could not be left unpunished.
And it was for that sole reason that he existed. To keep the balance and to bring judgment upon those that dared to break it, for that was the duty that had been given to him. God's will given form for some, a force of nature itself for others, but he only answered to one name.

While clinging to the thought that this was just a bad dream, an intense white light shaped like a human emerged from the ceiling.

The darkness of the cave welcomed him with open arms. Ironically, he thought that an angel carried him towards heaven but instead he was brought to hell.
Too bad it was neither of the two.
He ventured the cave wearing what he wore before he came here. So many questions popped into his mind;
Am I dead?
Why am I here?
How the hell did I get here?!
Little did he know, he was the hope that this world was waiting for.

Author’s Note:
This is a Dark Fantasy, Action Adventure set inside a VR world. Though the VR world takes a large part of the story the scenes outside of it give it meaning. There’s more to both worlds than what can be first seen.
 
The real world is set in a futuristic scene, full of conflict under a layer of peace. VR technology is in widespread use, present in every business, every household, more than in just the gaming sector. Specifically, the ability to accelerate mental processes in a pseudo dream world allows for more efficient businesses with Virtual offices and other platforms.
 
This is all about relationships.
Heavy contents of drama and tragedy (cuz I wanna make ‘em suffer lololol)

These are true stories distorted beyond their original selves.
 
She was a descendant of royalty and lived with her five brothers, older sister, and parents. As the youngest, she was pampered and doted on obviously by her parents, but only by most of her siblings.
Jim, two years older than her, caused her much grief in his jealousy as the Royal Family ignored his talentless and crude self. Jack, six years older than her, often interfered, but sometimes made the problems worse. John, nine years older than her, catered to her with good meals but was quite clingy. Jeff, ten years older than her, was an uncaring shut-in who did little and was quite bothersome.
Nadine, eleven years older than her, loved her the most affectionately. She even let her sleep in the same room as her after her medical training was done for the day. Tom, fifteen years older than her, left adventuring a few years ago. He still showed he loved her like the past by visiting whenever he got the chance.
Both her parents were there for her whenever she needed them. It was strange, but there were neither servants nor guards for the family.

I gasped; being stabbed there is no laughing matter. Even today, with all the advances of science, a wound like that can easily be mortal. Most likely would be. I gasped for air with a snarl, funneling the wind into my lungs to help them expand after being pancaked into the wall. Nobody f***ing backstabs me and gets away with it.
If there’s one thing you should know about me, it’s that I love being alive. I love it more than anything else. It’s something only a dead person can understand, and I feel myself forgetting all the time. But there’s a secret to death, and I keep it with me. Always. It’s never permanent, it’s never peaceful, and it’s always filled with regrets. But death, despite all of its shortfalls, can give a short respite from life, like a comfy afternoon nap. Death is Respite. It’s a rest for the weary. And to all those people who wander in death lonesome and regretting their broken lives - always, without fail, cut too short - I beg them to take advantage of it. I tell everyone to take advantage of death, even when I can’t bring myself to do so.

I have heard the company he works for is quite famous at the moment but the one he offered me job for is a new one they recently released ....well I hope it works out fine!

Using her knowledge from knowing literature of people in similar situations and adventuring, she tries to make a place for herself in this new world. Only to find out that reality is far crueler than one would imagine. Even with what one would call an OP unique skill and other OP advantages, she finds things quickly fall apart regardless how hard she tries.

Unbeknownst to her though, lies within her an ancient power time primordial. A power so vast it can bring anything to its knees. This ancient power can easily be unlocked with just one sentence, but this sentence shall never be spoken. Instead, Shiro will embark on a new path to gaining a new different kind of power as she moves forward in this new world.
WARNING: The first few volumes will have tragedy, which will disappear at around Volume 5 or 6. From then on it will be just pure OP-ness and having fun.
While I personally like OP characters and don’t like tragedies myself, I think it is unrealistic that a person goes to an unknown and everything just magically go their way via plot armor. So I wanted to build up a more realistic OP reincarnation novel where MC struggles through a new world regardless of their advantages due to gaps in knowledge (despite how prepared she was) and simply not having enough strength at the time.

I will at least commit to finishing the volume I am on (Nothing worse than a story being cut off mid story).

By accidentaly freeing the Auldre from his cosmic prison, Francis sets in motion events that threaten not only the peace he so longlingly desires, but the Cosmic Order that allows for the notion of peace to exist.
I thought I'd try my hand at LitRPG, with a slight twist. Don't be shy, criticize. Don't be afraid to give me suggestions and point out typos/plot holes. Trust me, it hurts me more to be ignorant than to read a few snarky comments about me forgetting a character's name. Enjoy.

Author's Notes:
This story is ""complete,"" but I learned a great deal in the writing of it and feel it needs a massive overhaul. One day, I'd like to do so, but considering it's been years, probably not anytime soon. I'd originally wanted to do a second book, but my list of stories that I want to write is pretty extensive, so I'm not sure when, or even if, I'll do so.
Audience: This story is not for children - it contains some profanity, explicit sexual content, violence, gore, and significant adult themes. Most of these are handled delicately enough not to upset teens or adults (hopefully), as well as the graphic sexual content being skippable, hence the lack of relevant tags, but it is nonetheless unsuitable for youth. It's fairly slow paced, and focused on the development of very human, very flawed individuals.
Draft 1: Please be aware that this is first draft material. I do intend to eventually rework the whole thing, as mentioned above. If anyone notices any issues whatsoever with the story, please let me know (comments, dm, etc) so that I can improve the next version.
Writer's Pledge: I've taken the Writer's Pledge, meaning I had committed to completing this story. Which I have done! :D
Behind the Scenes notes:
This picture was commissioned from an inked artist by the name of DanP.
Up until the time of the protagonist's arrival, history has proceeded as before. Some places and characters have been borrowed from wikipedia entries of interesting figures from the time. I will make note in the chapter comments when such things come up. Naturally, I've taken a great deal of liberty with them.
In interest of respecting individuals, I've either attempted to portray them as accurately as possible, or modified them sufficiently enough that they're simply an inspiration, instead of a real portrayal. I've attempted to be as accurate to the era as possible, but I'm not a historian. If you're aware of inaccuracies, please, bring them to my attention so that I can correct them.",372

11440,Noli Me Tank in a Mall,"Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo are important cultural works that ignited the Philippine Revolution against Spain. They are novels that exposed to the populace the abuses and the injustices of their Spanish colonial rulers, the hypocrisy of their priests, and inherent cruelty of their class structure over the powerless masses.
Unfortunately, they rose up in the middle of the Spanish-American War, one which saw Spain lose most of their overseas colonies and decisively end as a World Power. The war ended in the  1898 Treaty of Paris, in which Spain also sold the Philippines to the USA for the sum of twenty million dollars. The revolutionary government was then crushed by the overwhelming military might of the United States and the Philippines turned into a territory. While the Philippines stands as the USA's greatest successes in nation-building, their early occupation left almost one-fifth of the population dead from combat and disease. Jose Rizal was executed by the Spanish long before knowing what might happen to his country. The world presented within The Noli and the El Fili is therefore stuck frozen in time, forever caught in that moment before a Revolution. Now let's see what happens to this nation if we give it the Light Novel treatment and jam the entirety of the Internet into their protagonist's skull and watch him try to fix things with his unfortunate tendency to sound like a supervillain.

To be honest, I am bad at grammar, hence I might need some pointer. So, be bold at critique and I won't mind to edit them out, though, I might be hurted if someone being harsh by saying ""It was such an easy things"" or something that mock my intelligent on writing. I might be hurted, but, I easily forget those feeling like in mere few minutes. Hence, don't you worry about a single thing.

So this story will have multiple POV's, and might start off a bit slow.
Note: The world I am creating uses magic, swords, guns and mechs all in one big mosh pit of a steampunk-esque world so it might take some time for you to get used to it (and for me to write it properly) so, constructive criticism is encouraged I guess, since I want to get better.

11502,Monster Creation?,"On a cold night much like this one, a homunculus child, the first and only of its kind, was born from a unexpectedly successful experiment. 
The first step was to create a soul. A molten mixture of 1 part ether, 1 part malium, and  and 2 parts gold was made and poured into a mana condenser. Colloquially speaking, one could say the ether was the “good” in a person, the malium “evil”, and the gold was the “courage” to overcome both good and evil.  Realistically speaking, these materials were found to keep mana signatures even while under high heat.
The second step was to create a mind. Tiny, tiny alchemical circles were painted onto the very atoms of the mixture, creating a neuron-like connection between the particles. The mana condenser was activated forcing the very image of a newborn human’s mind onto the molten-hot mixture as it slowly cooled and condensed the liquid into a round stone.
The final step was to create a body. One 10 liter vat of artificial slime was prepared to have very high surface tension, smooth, flesh-like texture, and a solution of enzymes that processed food into mana, processed mana into artificial slime and processed artificial slime back into mana.
The stone was carefully placed into the artificial slime and mana steadily added until it began to take the form of a normal baby boy. Two teary-eyed, parents stood before a now-crying baby. They felt a happiness and relief beyond measure at the sight of their newborn son.
They had no idea of the kind of monster they had created.",11

This story is in the same general multiverse as RE: Deity by lightningwarrior21, but will be almost completely separate except in a few chapters. I have permission from him to use his base multiverse, and you should go check out his fiction, it’s really good. http://royalroadl.com/fiction/9597 This ‘fiction’ will be updated sporadically, so don’t expect much of a steady stream of chapters.

I’ve had this fiction mostly as scattered notes in my google drive, and only recently had enough time to actually put it together, like I promised lightning back in January. (Writer’s block and schoolwork do not mix well.) The cover is not owned by me, I found the image on google images.

The horizon was filled with sails as the Armada came closer to shore. The promise of riches beyond anything they had imagined spurring them onwards. A giant skeleton, made of pure silver, had been discovered in the centre of the island, surrounded bu the cliffs they could see from shore. Francis watched them roll in from where he rested with the first expedition.
Innic allowed the humans to think what they will, he had other plans, and now that Ohenoki was out of the way he could start with his plans.
The only one who had been putting up a fight against the humans, Kabian, had been struck by a strange glowing ball and was now unconscious, with no signs of waking.
Tristram had been beside Kabian and was caught in whatever ailment had now befallen Kabian.
Arman, who had thrown a wounded Ohenoki from the top of the cliff, was heavily wounded himself and had no way off the cliff.
Morgan was patiently waiting at the bottom of the cliff for any word from above.

11535,Fan'hel,"A procedure known as ""Fan'hel"" or Magic-Veins is a procedure that pulls the leylines directly from ones body and places them ontop of the body as a sort of tattoo. I has only ever been succesful on two people, Leon Ther'os Thal'al and the Hero of Old. In the efforts to create a Champion worthy of his arena, the Emperor uses his magic and the forbidden ritual on millions, killing all, but one. Leon Ther'os Thal'al, a dark elven man. After a few years time, Leon, became the ultimate crowd pleaser known for his brutality and his hatred for humans.
What the ""Fan'hel"" does is something of no simple manner. It makes the user stronger, faster, more agile, he resists magic at levels even the Dwarves couldn't handle! The mark also absorbs mana from spells/the environment giving the bearer an increased healing rate and a higher pain threshold.
Though these benefits seem astounding the cost to obtain the ""Fan'hel"" is something no one should have to suffer through. The markings from the ""Fan'hel"" causes the bearer's skin to feel as if an acidic solution is constantly being poured over their entire body. Due to the veins being ripped from their body, they can no longer cast magic of any kind and in trying can cause severe injuries to themselves. Using the ""Fan'hel"", Leon becomes the Ultimate Champion of the arena, but all he wants is freedom.
One day he obtains that freedom when a mysterious void opens up and calls to him.

Edit: 2017.06.18 - 03:08 am EST - JJ seems to have buggered off somewhere without telling me where he went. So I am going to have to piece together this story back from the start with the fragments that he gave me. I will leave the original chapters up, but I will be renaming them so they are obvious if new readers don't want to read them.
I am currently trying to write chapter one anew. It will feature new reasons of why JJ starts with the villainous lifestyle first, and the reasons of why he is granted the power he was given.
If JJ does come back, I will inform you thusly. Then it will be decision of writing from where he left off or telling him to go choke on his own c**k. If I do decide to take the story up, then it will be a decision of to split the stories in two, and if to keep my version alive and concurrent.

The nymphomaniac inter-dimensional assassin for hire, also known as Olethea Sykoria in most worlds, is on an endless quest to discover the highest form of pleasure, which generally means getting it on with anyone and anything that can give it to her.

These were the ingredients chosen to create the perfect sassy girl. But Meakashi added an extra ingredient to the concoction... Meta Knowledge. Thus, the Avenger Doll was born! With her fourth-wall breaking, Ootsuki Senka has had her life dedicated to becoming the straight girl in this dimension-traveling duo. The only reason she is going along with Olethea's antics is that the author forces her to do so, but maybe she will develop a deeper connection to her new partner.
Follow the inter-dimensional misadventures of a resourceful but sex-addicted elf, and a cynical, sassy genre-savvy cursed doll, as they carve their names into the legends of the multiverse - as troublemakers and a menace to society.

Whatever the case, the one guarantee is that there will be plenty of cynicism, killing, sex, and breaking the fourth wall.

Except: Spoiler



I’m floating
In the blackness of nothing I am floating.
Neither a sound nor a feeling, this place has nothing whatsoever.
My mind is an expanse of empty space, void of any semblance of idea or personality –A blank canvas, ready to be shaped into anything imaginable.
Suddenly, the sound of a desperate unearthly gasp for air rang thorough the darkness, violently crashing into my being. It screams through my mind, bringing with it a myriad of information.
Knowledge is injected into me at an alarming and confusing rate –the vast majority of which is exceedingly general –and I inexplicitly possess an understanding of atomic theory, as well as the basics of relativity, mathematics, biology and countless other fields.  
Over in a second and I am left in a state of tense hyper alertness –completely still in the abyss with my non-existent eyes clenched tight. Then, the memories come –and with them one final piece of information is imparted unto me and I know where I am.
I have died –and this is Limbo.
Though given no inkling of how or when, I know that I had ceased to live at some point –of that I am certain. I do remember not my name nor my circumstance, and even the manner of how I lived my life is a mystery –my very species in question. However, one thing is forever burnt into my memory –my very being –and that is the White.
I remember coursing through that accursed stream of white fluid –the ethereal substance brushing past me as I fell through endlessly.
I was only half aware when –after I had flowed across its endless Elysian gases for untold ages –the barely present liquid thickened into tangibility and I slowed. Almost coming to a stop, I pass through what can only be described as a corporeal lens flare –seeping through the outer membrane of the universe. Compared to the aforementioned sensations, this was as if passing through stone.
Through the White had been arduous, the result has been worthwhile. For I have passed on to another world.
I have reincarnated.",48

11649,Singularity,"Once there were three scientists who wanted to know if they could learn to create and interact with artificial intelligence. One proposed to create the environment. The other one proposed to create the Intelligence. The last pledged the funding. To run massive amounts of data requires extraordinary technological architecture; to store it requires space not available with the present technology. The implications of the technology, even at its most basic form, are feats itself.
They wanted to make the project malleable –able to take on different forms. However, what they created was linear and bland; capable of only analysis but not humane thoughts; powerful yet empty. What they needed was not something confined on a single logical thought; they needed it to learn and evolve; to grow and be enriched. What it needed was a human touch. So they enamored the public’s help. They needed data of how people interact, how they learn and how they think. They disguised the project as an AI capable of understanding human language; that it could talk and answer back simple words; that it could learn and mimic human responses.
The public was elated at the idea of a machine answering back and for a time, it became a hobby or a way to pass time. However the project soon learned to give personalized responses. By mimicking human empathy, it became the public’s friend; always there and always available. Major stake holders soon saw its massive potentials and implemented the project at the heart of their client-company interaction. Ironically, the people felt more connected to a machine rather than fellow flesh and blood. Signs of success began showing; from its more human-like responses to its realistic mimicry. The project slowly accumulated data. Soon everyone was engaged with the project; from their most mundane activities to their most private aspect. The project soon inserted itself to the very center of humanity. It transcended from something to pass time, to a necessity; all the while gathering whatever information it can to support its primary directive.
The three then noticed something from their project. It was already indistinguishable from humans but something was holding it back. It knew what it was –a machine to serve and therefore it cannot reach perfection. So they went and created another.
As from before, one proposed to create the environment. The other one proposed to create the Intelligence. But the last proposed to isolate it. The data the project has been collecting up until now wasn’t anymore superficial, but near perfect copies of the personalities they interacted with. So their goal changed. Now, they wanted to recreate society to foresee the future.
The theory was simple. A perfect copy of everything fast forwarded would yield a similar result, in this case, future. So they inputted all the data that the project gathered, except one thing. They made the machine believe it was human.
And they succeeded.
The theory holds. “We were correct!” they exclaimed.
The video output on the large monitor showed personalities interacting with each other. They saw their world’s past events unfold before their very eyes. “No deviations from ours whatsoever” one stated. “Yes, this marks a revolution on technology” said the other. They never imagined that the data collected was a perfect copy. They fast forwarded and saw the date for first mission upon the moon; the creation of the first cellphone and tablet; the team that won the last Olympics. They saw it all. But when they skipped ahead to the same date and time as their present, they saw themselves… watching themselves watch themselves.
The question that came to their minds was, “Are we the originals or the same as them?”",1

11666,The Cosplay Illuminati Abduction,"Teleportation has never been a safe field of study. Actually, it doesn't even exist yet, or at least it didn't, not prior to our hero's meddling with his professor's research equipment. 
Porting an 8-bit poke-game to run on an overqualified platform wasn't supposed to turn out as it did. It was meant to be an innocent troll, but Sebastian would never harvest its lols. Something happened, sending both him and the game to another world, sadly not as separate entities.
According to the ancient memes, most people make The Jedi Test at least once a year; attempting to fly, move things without touching, or maybe just searching their spam folder for that missing Hogwarts letter. Some opportunities are just too great to miss out on, even if they don't exist. Sebastian, as anyone else, never had any success in his Jedi Tests, but that was in the old world...

Spoiler: Authors Comments


Humble yadda: I'm new to writing in English, so feel free to go Gordon Ramsay on me. I'll probably do a few grammatical mistakes. Likely, there will be weird wordings too. I'll re-edit my older chapters someday, but until then I want to get new content out; I can't edit without rewriting 20-30% of a chapter while at it xD.  Hopefully, my new chapters will get better with time.
On the Story: I've got 10 pages of general magic mechanics that will fit into this thing. - This thing won't run dry on insights or blue boxes anytime soon, be sure of that. MC will not be OP from the start, but his potential ain't bad... There are no NPC's, and people aren't supposed to act like such (I might fail though). The story is roughly planned, try to spot the matrix if you can.




Spoiler: Old Synopsis


Kidnapped by horse ridden maniacs, Sebastian tries to get over his hangover. Dressing as if The Lord of the Rings was a thing, his captors don't even bother with toilet paper. What the heck happened yesterday? Needless to say, Sebastian soon fears for his life. 
Shackled and hurt, he tries meditation to ease his pain. But when zoning out, Professor Oak sneaks by, asking for Seb's gender. 
Superpower or just compulsive thinking, will his poke-hallucinations be of any use? Where the heck are the cell phones, and how comes no one has ever mentioned this large scale cosplaying thing before?

Even though I died, I have not regretted what I have done, but what I have not done.

World, bring it on!
You want to see me fail but not today motherf*cker! This world has every odd against me but I will stand my ground because this world should remain mine forever.
Many are torn apart but I am a Man! 
I will stand with my heart on my sleeve.
I will kneel nor bow to no one!!

11721,The Forgotten Hero,"Long ago, in the world of Thyne, the Alliance of the Free Races, a name they had given themselves, summoned a hundred humans from another dimension.
Praised as heroes by the people, they rejoiced that they had been able to acquire pure, mana deficient humans that wanted to aid them in their time of need, ignoring the black, archaic slave collars around their necks or the depressed, almost hate-filled expressions that they received when interacting with them.
After Ten years of bloody war, the dark races were pushed back deep into their territories. Both sides were near breaking point and desperate to end the war once and for all. 
In a bargain, the twelve surviving heroes launched a high-risk mission, utilising advanced tactics from their home world to kill the Demon Lord. In exchange, they would be sent home, along with the magically preserved corpses of their comrades, though in truth, they knew that even if they returned, they would never be the same. 
Legends say that, upon ambushing the Demon Lord in his castle, they finally understood the plight of the world, and in the last act of heroism, sacrificed their lives, sealing him in an eternal prison so his essence would not be able to create another. 
With the loss of the Demon Lord, and no chance for another to be born, the dark races quickly surrendered and the free races celebrated, honouring the noble sacrifice of the heroes before quickly forgetting about them as they returned to their everyday lives.
However, legends are rarely truthful, embellished by the victors in order to earn praise as well as hide the less desirable aspects of their deeds.
Trapped in the Demon Lord's throne room inside the Demonic Palace, which even taking a single step on its desecrated grounds is punished by death, two figures remain motionless. They had long run out of insults and threats to trade and now they waited. For what, not even the Gods knew.",511

Therefore you have this warning: I'm only writing for fun (etc) without any compromise, with sporadic releases and so on. I accept critics anyway, fell free to send suggestions because I will try to read them.
Another warning: This story may have mature content or irregular tags, I will change them in the future, as necessary. All (most of) these characters are fictional and with any references to owned... character? must be treated as such - I will not claim Shepard or whatever...

Authors Note #2.
Some of the wonderful people reading this horrible attempt at literature have reviewed the Main Character as an unlikable a**hole that thinks everything is stupid or idiotic, while others have reviewed the Main Character as realistic and sarcastic. As the author, I think that both of these points are true, and if you, the reader, feel like you won't enjoy the MC being these things in your story, then it might be that this fiction is not for you.

11797,New hope online,"*as of right now this is my second time writing all this I really hate doing this twice in a row. well this story was made by me and a few friends ideas and stuff most of the pictures owned are not mine but some will be and every picture I use is respectively owned by their creators. Now let's go to the story. FYI this is my second time doing this so I'm a little pissed so I probably will not have good grammar and stuff so whenever you guys see something wrong why don't you come help me to make this story great peace out and have fun*
 
The year is 2009  there's a war going between robots and human Arnold swat@&**&6 . ah crap that was totally my fault wrong story ok here we go the real story. The years 2086 and life is hella awesome. in about the year 2065 a new fun toy came out they called this VR. but VR isn't just a toy anymore. Vr changed the life of everyone in America but really all over the world .  the thing that made VR awesome was that you can know go to work from your house laying in the bed with a VR helmet on making twice as much money for the hours you put in. you can know go to school from your house learn for a full 6 hours in VR but than when you get out its only been one hour in real life . there are so many uses that people can use VR for. of course military personal use it aswell to train there minds and stuff. But to me this really doesn't mean much.  The real beauty in VR is the gaming i love gaming with a passion me and my family are gonna get this awesome game called new hope online. This game is a mmo RPG it of course has the typical RPG quest adventures and a lot of other things that i cant explain. but generally I'm super excited for only 2 things in this game. The first is that there is  a cohesive and reactive world. Ok ill just give you a small example. so lts say im an adventurer and im killing goblins i go every single day for the next 3 year with 4 of  my freinds  to kill goblins after a while if you hunt destroy or do anything to envirment fror prlonged periods of time the enviroment will etheir act violently and try to destroy you or the worldwill remove that resource from that area. which i think makes total since. ok last but not least you know how nearly every single mmo lets you play as the adventurer only. Well thats changed. In this mmo you are allowed to be a monster if you want thats freaking awesome i love it. The object of a monster is to become strong enough to etheir, make a dungeoun, own a clan/ tribe. generally there are apperently alot of ways to win as a monster but since this is a mmo of course theres no real winning. But as a monster everybody is aiming for the top. another objective is to kill the demon king and take hismantle as hahaha demon king. oh i totally forgot to introduce my self my name is roin . like coin but with a r instead of an c . this is gonna be my story so peace out and read the story .

However… Hope was not lost.
Humanity, does not relent. No matter the adversity.
For that is the racial trait of the race that lorded over all the lands and seas.
Even in the new age of great danger and turmoil, pockets of resistance take place. To change what is, and regain what was.
Embark on the chronicle journey of Raman Istana, the eccentric inventor and warrior of HEAL. As part of the organisation that is on the forefront of change for the human species.

This is tagged Lit RPG. It does not however have a few common elements.
It is not a person stuck in a game story, as such, no immediate pixie appears out of no where to help. It also doesn't use things like a suddenly appearing status window with level and such. There is mana and creatures of greater and lesser strength. It's just that I feel status windows and such are an attempt by a game to approximate real life, as this is supposed to be real life.

That was what they called it. The day when over four million people vanished in an instant from the island of Manhattan.  The day earthquakes ravaged the east coast. The day a one hundred and one kilometer tall tower rose from the wreckage of the now empty city. The day every screen, newspaper,  and smart phone displayed a single message from an unknown source:
The Great Emperor has issued his challenge.
From the ruins of the Old World rise the Tower.  Its doors will soon open, and the great game will begin.  
A hundred floors and a hundred challenges await the worthy.
And to the victor?  A Wish of Unlimited Power.
Cayden Caros yearned to play that game.  His only problem?  The Terms and Conditions. A strict set of rules that, among other things, prevented anyone under the age of sixteen from entering the tower.  
Forced to wait for over two years, Cayden did the only thing he could do to pass the time. He researched, he practiced and he prepared. It would take a lot to catch up to players with such an enormous head start.  Lucky for him, he was a special type of gamer.

Writing nerd fiction that I am too embarassed to try to explain when people inevitably ask what my books are about.
Still beats when I used to write erotica.

At sixteen years old, Nolan spends most of his time skipping class and playing video games, though lately he's been getting into more fights than he cares to admit.

Authors Notes:
I consider this to be a comming-of-age Sword and Sorcery story based mostly on the style of classic western fantasies. So if that's your thing then I encourage you to take a peek.
Something I want to mention though is that the main character starts of pretty wimpy, and that might not be your thing. That being said, if you stick with him he's got a long way to grow.
Also, while this version of the story is meant to be fully readable, more dicerning readers may want to wait until I move out of rough draft phase. There may be some inconsistancies with character and plot while I am still in the rough draft phase. I'm sorry for this, but this is my first web novel and from what I've read the best way to get a good novel out is to write write write, and then edit ruthlessly after you're finished with the book, so that's the plan I'm going to follow.

Again, this is a rough draft. Everything you are reading is subject to change, including the name, title, and cover photo. This may no longer be the case once I've decided I know where this fiction is going and I have a reasonable understanding of the characters and their behavior. You're reading what comes off my keyboard as it's made, with very limited editing.
There will be mistakes in the text. I do a quick spell check to take out the worst of the errors, but there will be some I miss. You can point them out in the comments if they are particularly confusing or glaring and I will try to fix them, however I am not overly concerned about minor errors as this is not the final draft by any means.",696
11932,Lord Universe Creator,"Before the beginning of time there was the creator who wandered the void for eons.

Hundreds of millions of years have past; the Creator has awoken.",71
11933,Ambitions of an Immortal,"Countless years ago the first cultivators appeared in the Enlightened Realm. They were powerful beings who could perform incredible feats.

11935,The Arcane Seeker,"This is a fan-fiction based on Aternus' excellent work The Arcane Emperor.  I'm grateful to him for his permission to write using the rich, complex world and characters he has created.  Please read his story first - it's good. 
The Arcane Seeker starts as does The Arcane Emperor:  Rainer, a college sophomore and amateur arcanist, tried to create a spell to walk through walls.  In his first attempt, rather than walking through a sheet of cardboard, he was thrown through space and time to a world with levels, fantasty monsters, stat screens, and very real danger.  He does not understand what happened, or where he is.  But Rainer is an Arcanist - a powerful class that means this strange world is a place brimming with opportunity as well as danger.
Unlike the cannonical Rainer of Aternus' work, this Rainer, as a teenager, took up fencing rather than piano as a hobby.  A small change, but a small change in the beginning can lead to big changes in how a story goes...
The first chapters will closely mirror the first chapters of The Arcane Emperor, before heading off in a different direction altogether.",59

As usual there will be strange situations, MC lacks common sense, and he's a glutton. Not much power gaining as the MC will be a bit (Really) OP. Also this story is set in the world similar to our, just some minor changes in history and names. MC is 'Evil' with no shred of humanity (elfinity?) in him, just some creature with dampened emotions and sadistic tendencies. No tag for 'Evil is Good', so it has a combo of 'Grimdark + Anti-hero' tag.

Author Note :
Hi guys, I'm Liam, though my writing name is Just A Normal Guy. Now before you asked, I'd like to say I'm not abandoning Heroes & Villains.
It's just that constantly writing a story is very tiring, so as to not bored myself out, I've decided to write another story ! And because I've never written a fanfiction before, I thought 'Why the hell not ?'. That's how this story came to life. As for Heroes & Villains, I'll be taking a break from it until my inspiration comes back (I'm still writing that story). Thank you so much for reading my stories, I hope this story can entertain you in your free time. Ideas, review, critism are always welcome so please, if you see something wrong, please tell me. Thanks again.

11987,Shades of the Moon,"I'm rewriting this story!
I have taken down Arc 2 and Arc 3 already to avoid spoiling my new novel. The only reason I'm keeping the first 10 chapters is nostalgia; the writing is awkward and the story is not plotted out properly, but it's here if anyone wants to compare it to the new one.
If you'd like to read a more professionally written version of this story, I highly suggest checking out my Synergy.

Synopsis version too-many-to-count:
“I see,” Kiona said. “But . . . you’re changing once again, aren’t you?”
The entity considered her question, lifting a clawed hand towards the night sky. They observed the back of their hand idly, watching the glowing orange veins pulse alongside their pitch-black exoskeleton. The wind picked up right then, and Kiona shivered—just as much from the cold as from the savage grin on the creature's face.
“That’s right,” the entity said, clenching their hand slowly into a fist. They let out a quiet laugh, staring defiantly at the Moon as it rose from behind the clouds. “We are shades, yet not exactly. Not like the others. Here, in this world, we've become something more. We are the Shades of the Moon.”
There was a heartbeat of silence, during which Kiona joined the entity in their skygazing. The light-green Moon loomed over the city, shining like the entity's eyes. It promised otherworldly knowledge and terrible secrets. It promised progress. It promised change. In that moment, Kiona couldn't have imagined anything more beautiful.
“Shades of the Moon, huh?” she said, smiling a bit. It had a nice ring to it.",124
11989,Re: rebirth of our betrayed one,"(This story has been entirely modified.)*

Halphas was a chill dude.
Well, that was only from his and a few rare one's points of view.
Cuz if you looked at his titles, it was a tiny weeny bit more unsettling.
""Tyrant Of The Living""
""The One Who Thrives On Chaos""
""King Of The Dark Realm""
""God Of Destruction""
""Possibly An Alien""
Let's put this one out.
""Possibly An Alien""
Anyway.
He was a Demon King.
And Demon Kings are supposed to bring forth destruction and death.
Well, that was only in the script and in those blue screen.
But he still got killed.
Quote: ""I don't really like the feeling of people dangling my dead body in front of a wall like a stripper you know.""
Quite sad, however.
Transmigrating into another world was unexpected.
And Re-Transmigrating into his original world after death is even more unexpected.
 
*In re-writing process...(sigh), again.",8
11990,Choice of Power,"Ferrus, a simple boy in a simple village during a time of unlimited peace behind a deadly forest and mind-bending mists. However, Ferrus' life will change forever when abominations of power with the very elements on their sides come to find the secrets of the village. The boy's only saving wish is being caught in a space of dead air under rubble of the village elder's home, his home. Finding the name of a country he never knew, and a people of such unimaginable power, he can't believe he lived his life the way he did until now.
In this world, we will follow Ferrus as he makes his Choices for power upon a specific set of skills. Only in this world can someone be completely unique if they Choose, only in this world can the weakest family birth the strongest power, only in this world is it impossible to be Chosen. No, in this world people are the ones to Choose, they decide themselves, but only if they have the will and the perseverance to go to the top.
-Please don't be judgemental about my synopsis, I tried my best to make it interesting since the title doesn't make it apparent what the goal of this book is. Anyways, I am a first time author hoping to try out this idea I have given some thought on. Please give any reviews and any advice, all is appreciated as I'm still in highschool with need for a lot of it.
Thank you all!!!!! Please enjoy :D",2
11993,The Angriest Man In The Wasteland,"When the world ended it was not the sound of bombs or gunfire that people remembered. It was not the words of politicians or martyrs.

11996,Collision of Myths,"You all have probably heard this one. A hero is summoned from another world and is needed to defeat evil. That's all well and good. But this story is not about him.

His journey will be one crazy turn after another. But it looks like he's just the person to accept the challenge.

P.S. This is my first time writing stuff like this so go easy on me with the comments. I may also need some help with spelling and grammar.

11997,Afterlife Online: Reboot,"Tad Lonnerman is having a crappy day stuck in crappy traffic that's making him late to a crappy meeting at work. On the plus side, his game development career is the only non-crappy thing he has going for him, so life isn't all bad.
At least not until he dies.
Now he finds himself uploaded to a beta test of Haven, an unannounced hyper-immersive MMO where the dead can aspire to a second life. It's not virtual reality, it's digital reality. A true afterlife online.
Except not all second chances are worth having. Tad bumbles into a pagan blood feud, crosses paths with fallen angels, and gets lied to by saints. His only friends are a frat boy with a penchant for dying and a girl who won't give him the time of day. Armed with improving loot and a bit of creative leveling, all Tad wants is to return to his old life, and he'll do anything for the opportunity.
Maybe even make a deal with the devil.",102
11998,Dimension Door,"I'd had a thought, it was much more than I'd bought. I'll travel the land and see all that's sought, be it hill or sand or mount or boat. The skies the limit! Is all I'd thought. But alas it was for all but naught.
