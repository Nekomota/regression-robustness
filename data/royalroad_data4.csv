Looking at my front, left. right, back. up and down, I concluded that I was in a forest. What's more, I wasn't in my own body anymore! Well, I already considered this body to be my second body because of a certain game though. Well, for now that's not the case, Judging from the above descriptions I managed to squeeze out of my dried up brain. I think it's safe to assume that I'm not on Earth anymore.
First is obviously because of the body and the forest. The second one is kinda special. You see, it seems like I can use magic here. Furthermore. the knowledge of what to do and why I can do it is all stoed up in my head. So, don't blame me for thinking that I am no on Earth anymore, okay?
Ahh, also, because of my shut-in nature, I decided to live inside this forest though. I have been a shut-in for one and a half decade already. So meeting up with unknown strangers in an unknown world with an unknown culture and language feels kinda hard. 
No, let me be blunt. I-M-P-O-S-S-I-B-L-E!!!
So cut me some slack on this one. With that said, time to hole up in the middle of a forest!
After a while of immersing myself in magic research, who knew that 3000 years had passed by already.
Nn? You wanna know what I did during those 3000 years? It's simple! I fought against monsters with my magic, did some reasearch on magic and got blown away by my own magic! In short, I was doing some magic stuff!
As for why I'm still alive after 3000 years, don't ask me. I don't know. Maybe, god did something. Anyways, after living for 3000 years on this world, maybe it about time for me to explore the world and see some nice views.",56

However, since this is not the main story, I won't be able to update it as fast as Fantasial Apocalypse. In any case, this was just one of my wish-fulfillment kind of story so please don't be so strict about it~ (^-^)V - This is just for fun!

Daniel Flores died and was almost virtually revived by his lover/fiancee who turned out to be an evil mad scientist from a huge terrorist group. During his revival her lover/fiancee added some kind of experiment to his brain in order for his revival to be succesful. However, this was suddenly interrupted by a peace keeping force. And so, his revival failed.
He died.
However, suddenly he was transmigrated to another him from a parallel world.

Sadly, as humanity expanded to the stars so too did their desire for power, and with the coming increases in alien species joining the new Galatic union, new religions start to appear, which would later see to humanity forming the Ascendancy; a religious based government that had started with the best intentions to bring religious unity to the Milky Way. However, power corrupts and humanity quickly started to warp the ideals of the new government and instead formed a belief where humanity was the top, and all other races were subservient -with some circles even going so far as to call the aliens slaves- which would lead to the Ascendancy of Humanity becoming the dominant empire, but as all evil, it doesn't last as now, the outer core worlds including a few mid-core worlds began to rebel in defense of their alien friends and allies, and before long a full-scale war was waged between the Ascendancy of Humanity and the Galactic Confederation of Worlds.

What if you were dumped in some backwards cave somewhere, completely nude, maybe with your family, or even completely alone?
The age of pioneers, heroes, generals, and geniuses is long gone. Humankind has become numb to the world around it because of how paltry everything else is compared to the glory of its history, the sheer volume of their accomplishments, and the sum of its innovations. You can interact with people across the world, travel miles in mere hours, and never prepare your own food or shelter, and it's all accessible to even the normalest of individuals. Artificial intelligence is within arms reach in devices and computers and even houses, and neural interfaces aren't exclusive to the rich and powerful at this point.
Someone far in the distance took notice of Earth, saw the multitude of hairless apes swarming its surface. That one went down the checklist to see if humanity had, in fact, beaten the 'game' of Life. Sure enough, they had gone above and beyond the requirements, but nobody had been watching. 'Why might that be?', that one wondered. Protocol was protocol, though, no matter how strange the situation was. They pulled the lever, they flipped the switch.
It's time for New Game +.

We found out that it was just the flicker and hum of The System warming up. Now we see the true cost of our new world.
A Dark comedy that focuses on a few of the many people who aren't stuck in a high level dungeon when our world is translated and joined to Our Shattered Realms.
 

 
This is my first story that I have published. I welcome any criticism that you have for me. Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy!",119
13205,SINFONIA: Oneshots,"A collection of short stories following Claude, Jet, Leon, Walter and Rick and their life in the Victorian-esque all-male boarding school they attend. Although all of them are very different from each other, they all have something in common: adventures and trouble seem to follow each of them wherever they go. Most of these stories detail the pasts of the characters, notably that of Claude's as he ambitiously makes his way from the new junior student to the equally feared and adored idol of the all-boys school. 
These characters will be featured in an upcoming visual novel, but the stories mostly happen before the events of the actual game, and as such no further context is necessarily needed to read these stories (in fact, these are more like preparation for the VN)! More info of the VN itself here http://kuuras.weebly.com/sinfonia.html 

""Are you going to sing to us?"" the boy continued and laughed, now directing his attention entirely to Claude instead of the group of juniors as whole. ""Or will you give me a kiss? You're so pretty that you wouldn't need to sing or dance if you did that.""
He laughed again, but this time Claude interrupted him:
""Just one kiss? Is that all?"" he asked, as if he had taken seriously the other boy's obviously joking suggestion.
""Yeah, just one kiss,"" the other replied and laughed again at the junior student's naivety. Of course he had not been serious - even if he did admit the younger boy looked cute, like a girl, so it probably wouldn't be all that bad.  
""Fine, then,"" Claude nodded and took a confident step towards the senior. ""Just one kiss.""",0
13206,Apocalypse The Fantasy,"The world was suddenly shocked by the apocalypse of the aberrants. It first started with black fogs and many people started acting weird then was sent to the hospital.

Being infected by the aberrant would turn them into aberrants but they did not die. Then, whether live as human or aberrant, being killed by a human would cause them to reincarnate at the first time they activated their power.
Who pulled the string behind the scene? Why would they do it?
""That was none of my business.""
The woman said as she on her journey of her third life to find her treasured people. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=Do not talk about logic here. Because, not all logic will work inside this story. For example if everything must be logical, the world would be destroyed after a few years by the nuclear power plant that was not being taken care of. The story couldn't go on if it was like that. So, don't go tattle on me.

This my first work so please bear with me.
The novel does contain LitRPG aspects, however I hope to not make that the center of the story. I've read to many fictions where the plot of a story is carried by the LitRPG aspects. My goal is to have a plot and character driven novel which also contains LitRPG aspects in the background.

NOTE:
Consider this story as the first version. I want to keep working on it so that the story can actually finish at one point for future development. I want to eventually make it a webtoon comic, but the story still needs to be written and the art still needs be improved. So I'll keep writing for now, but expect the final result to be much better than the story now. Until then, I hope we can have a great time together with this writing experiment. Thanks!",27

When a popup based on Terror Infinity showed up in Matthew Forester's browser, he did what any sane person would do and clicked NO. Unfortunately the Lord God had evidently been taking lessons from advertisers and NO just opened a different offer.

13215,A Knight's Duty,"Henry Keiss, a knight of House Toris, is viewed only as a failure and a burden by his peers. With more losses than victories under his belt and a string of rumors that he is a ""cursed"" existence, Henry was the only surviving officer of the Battle at Blue Hill which took Lord Toris away from the world. Henry himself did not leave unscathed. 
 
The new Lord Toris views Henry as a stain, but values the integrity of an honest knight. He allows Henry to keep his position but essentially robs him of any titles and status he once had by relegating him to an unofficial babysitting duty and ""acquiring"" his land for the purposes of recovery. Henry is left as the protector of the black sheep of Toris, it's one-eyed son.
 
A bitter and weak noble child and the cynical failure of a knight that he blames for the death of his father. A combination that seems unlikely to cause anything but grief. The realm could not guess that these two would go on to do more than just lead the Toris into a new age. They would go on to change the realm itself.

sitting on a branch of Acacia firmly standing near the edge of a cliff, the young man gazes on the sun dipping its light on the sea, whilst the sea breeze gently blows on his scar ridden face he caresses a gun staring at it while making a sour face...
He then smiles and looks forward the vast blue sky tinged with orange, purple, and red.
""I'm going now, at least promise me to become a decent man...
hahahahahaha but I know, and you know..
I break my promises all the time...""
The young man points the gun in his mouth while tears uncontrollably drip from his eyes.

13219,"Meanings, meanings, meaning!","The Forest was calm, or perhaps it was just me imagining it. All that happened thirty minutes ago was like it had never existed: I ran for my life, thinking that it might be the end of this one, but here I was, in a place that had undoubtedly forgotten my existence or never took any interest in it from the beginning. For how long did I walk, I did not know. My head was turning, my sense dulled: my arms were numb, my legs heavy. I leaned my body against a tree and rested my head on the rough bark. My eyes managed to catch some of the rays of light penetrating through the leaves and bathed in their warmth. The scent of the pines was beyond any sweetness in the world. It filled my head with various emotions, memories that I had once rejected and thrown into the deepest pit in my brain. I had tried to suppress them, but they, once in a while, surged out of my body like water surging out of a broken dam. I closed my eyes.

Update 21/01/2020:
Author here. It's been a while since I've last been to this site. I have not given up on this story yet. Truth be told, I've actually accumulated over 300 chapters of this story.
However, as I progressed with the story, I've realised the plot holes that came up here and there as a result of my inexperience in writing. This, in turn, took me alot of re-writing and editing to resolve. Can't be helped since this is my first story.
This is the reason why I stopped posting additional chapters as I do not want to change those that has already been posted. Can't expect readers to re-read the chapter again after I made a change in it right?
So, after coming so far, I then found out that the story i've written is full of flaws. Thus, I've decided to overhaul the whole story and write a new one similar to the this but with a new title, this time, with proper planning.
Therefore, please look forward to it and support me when the time comes.",16

In such a world, a cry of anguish can lead to a small hope, a cry of desperation can lead to a warm and loving embrace , and a cry of helplessness can lead to freedom.
Will one man rise above all, or will he fail to stand up from the dirt from whence he came?

Dwelling in the heart of the Glorious Empire, Wulfram is one of the fabled Seven Sorcerers. Black Mages of immense dark power and almost no real desire to play by the rules other mages live by. Who care not for the suffering they put their bodies through, all in the name of obtaining unlimited power.

Wulfram will find few allies both inside and outside of the Glorious Empire's walls, and will find himself confronting his past, present and future.

What emerged from the pond was a tall reptilan creature, it's blue scaly hide lined with patches of bronze. It had a magnificent crest adorned with two large potruding horns, gleaming with the color of bronze. The Dungeon core was excited, a emotion it had never felt before. A strong monster had been spawned in the Dungeon! With great excitement it ordered it to protect it.
The scaly reptilian creature looked around itself in confusion, before it's eye's landed on the core. The core felt fear, a fear unlike never before. Before it could call for help, the lizard had already taken the Dungeon core towards it's mouth. With a terrifying chomp, the Dungeon core shattered within the mouth of the Lizard.
The sound of crunching and muching resounded within the dark cave, the illumination of the dungeon core growing dimmer. Soon, the cave was shrouded in darkness and with it an eerie silence. With the sound of water splashing out in a violent manner, roars of beasts echoed, breaking the silence.

Rafael Fuller, known as Never in the gaming world, would. The world would also be happy to be rid of him while he competes. As one of the premiere Achievement hunters in the world, Never has the reputation of being anti-social, abrasive, and forming alliances only for his own benefit.
When Alchemy Studios announced a full immersion MMO, he jumped at the chance not because of the money or recognition, though.
He did it because their parent company, AGI, has the medical resources he desparately needs.

She's tried other VRMMORPGs, but they've all been fantasy-based, with a couple sci-fi games thrown in. But she wants something more, something Super.
 
Superhero VRMMOs have had a... subpar reception in the past, in part due to the fact that the nature of most MMOs makes for fairly unheroic tales. After the couple hundredth time blasting the same group of mooks from the same faction on the same street corner of the same city, using the same powerset as everyone else because you only have a few options, it is hard to think of yourself as a hero anymore.

13267,Luck Lockyer,"Luck Lockyer was the type of man to smirk in the dark, the expression not for anyone but himself. One of perpetual amusement. The bright side of things were hard to find in the shade yet his amber eyes were always searching. The smirk was his default, he knew it, his friends knew it, his family knew it. It was his most natural state.
But the death of everyone close to you can affect a downwards curve on the mouths of even the most stoic people.
Without purpose, without anyone to do the job for, Luck Lockyer found himself inside an empty forgotten church. The perpetual smirk on his face had slipped to a thin line, his scar more noticeable now than ever before. His amber eyes, the windows to his soul, dull and lifeless. To anyone who knew him, it was the clothing that gave away his mental state, denim pants and a plain black t-shirt. If that wasn't enough, the tears running down his face certainly would, the echoing sobs of a broken man rang across the rundown church.
It was on a whim, but Luck Lockyer prayed, he prayed for many things, for death, revenge, friends, but the one prayer dominating his thoughts, a second chance for his family.
That was all he wanted. Simple.
It was then, on the outskirts of a polluted city, in an abondoned lot, in a forgotten church that Luck Lockyer, the Devil of the Cards, the Bloodless Hand, the Amber Demon, the Broken, was answered by a being from another world and one from his.

Author: Hello this is Phan. This story is inspired by Persona 5 and [Infinite Dendrogram]. English is not my native so do kindly advise me on my errors. Also this story going to mention a lot of names that I've yet to decide. So help me pick out few good names from ancient to foreign to whatever you find rings well. And for those who are thinking something along the lines of [2 of swords] and [ace of wands] and such it is not like that. Indeed it is a card and Arcana to boot but the game works much like embryo from [Infinite Dendrogram] where you can awaken powers that suits you but in a different form for example early spoiler the husband has the [Storm] Arcana due to his personality that faces everything head on and experiencing a total storm some time ago in the game. So pretty much Arcanas can be considered words. And how each work is up to the player to find out.",4

And maybe I will kill them off somewhere along the line, remember the Grand Line is dangerous^^.

13320,Unshackled,"Humanity had always been an arrogant species. They pushed into the reaches of space with confidence and authority because  they assumed that any sentient life they met would be rational, scientific species much like themselves. They were wrong...
Instead, they were exposed to a world of magic, gods, and entities that could not be explained or quantified by Einstein, Newton, or Darwin...
...Earth has long since been destroyed and humanity has been turned into slaves or servants by the advanced species of the universe. They are treated worse than animals because they do not possess the Spark. An untouchable, uknowable characteristic of all sentient species that allow them to use magic. Ket, the victim of violent and painful magical experimentation, acquires the Spark and begins his journey to free his people and reclaim a home. On his journey, he is besieged by a society that does not consider him worthy of self-determination, an obscure magical cult that believes he is the key to Ascension, a world-spanning empire that wants to see humanity eradicated, and a multitude of god-like beings who see mortals as nothing more than a means of entertainment.",2

However, little do they know that fate has a twist to spin. As they fight it out in a folorn map, they stumble upon a secret teleport gate. Out of curioisity, they all enter it. They find a world more graphicly advanced than the current number one game, and NPCs that really don't act like they should. The game settings are similar to Orge's Bone; there are no levels, only physical strenght gains, which is gained by killing monsters and completing quests. They treat the hidden world as their greenhouse– a place to retreat when the real world treats them unfairly. But after a while, they discover no everything is as it seems– that the hidden world is far more dangerous.

Ultimately, I'm writing this for enjoyment. If you enjoy it too, fantastic!
Gore: Extremely infrequent, but moderately intense.
Profanity: There are a few swear words here and there, as well as some more creative insults.
Traumatizing Content: While I'm at it, there are some questionable morals displayed (mostly after chapter 77). So far we can check off slavery, brainwashing, war, and genocide. 
This story starts off very Light Novel-ish because I was reading a lot of them at the time. The writing style gradually matures as it goes. Sorry, but I don't have the stamina to go back and fix everything, even if I know it gets pretty roughshod at times.
New readers, please keep in mind, I make use of ""unreliable narrators"" at times.
My story accepts donations, but it is free to read and I've only uploaded it here. 
Lastly, Orc Lord is a member of the WriTEr's Pledge, which means I have sworn to see it through to a satisfying ending. One of my long breaks triggered a dishonor, but I'll redeem it someday when it's actually finished. I'm the ultimate necromancer author. ;P","2,277"

An unassuming spacecraft, one of the dozens that fell yearly, descended on Siberia in 2021. The world took no particular notice of it. However, this one contained something beyond the miraculous technology that had made humans so prosperous.
Three years later, in a top-secret underground facility in eastern Colorado, the automated construction of an army of Paladin Mobile Infantry Suits was underway.

Unfortunately for him, that is no longer an option.

This is the first novel I've written. The first fifteen or so chapters are going to be a little slower. I want there to be time to get to know the characters before they start blowing stuff up.

13484,Arduous New World,"Alright, so I'm using this as a whetstone to practice my fiction writing. I have dyslexia, so bear with me if I have any mistakes, if you point them out I'll try and correct them. The story is LitRPG, I'll try and avoid some of the tropes, see FAQ. What happens is that the world turns out to be a simulation coming to an end, and beginning on its new simulation, in this process the system of the universe declares that the new simulation will be rpg-based. The protagonist however is thrust into an empty space before the simulation comes to an end, he escapes and finds that the world as he knew it is gone.Chapters will come sporadically as I'm quite busy IRL. FAQ1: There will be no Harem. 2: If any sexual content, it will be be below the screen, example sentence [they made love - or - they had sex]3: I'll try to keep character motivations steady instead of having characters who says and does one thing in one chapter, only to change their mind in the next one. 3: Villains or ""bad guys"" won't be charicatures. Of course, as in real life, you can meet these people, but as far as big bads or antagonists goes, they will have some modicum of intelligence. 4: The MC does not have an encyclopedia of random knowledge. 5: OP'ness won't happen overnight, and it is something that I'm wary of in terms of adding it, of course eventually the MC will grow more powerful, but there won't be any cheats, except hard work; and the luck factor will be more or less similar to the rest of the population. 6: He won't be opposing the universe, no matter how powerful he grows, he is too insignificant7: he won't become friends with god/the ghost in the shell etc, no matter how powerful he grows, he is too insignificant, and an ancient simulation ai has no interest anyway, why would it ? Okay that's that for now.",64

One to wander the realm in search of power, to protect themselves and what they believe in. They know their path to be the only one.
 
Writers note:
The first chapter will set the standard in terms of mood for the remainder of the story. It also comes to no surprise to me that half the people who read the first part stop reading any further. It has quite a bit of the good ‘ol ‘ultra-violence’ mixed with a great deal of realism. As much as I could fit into it from my own knowledge and experience in the elite forces.
The first few chapters will be slow, after, but starting from ‘Restless Destroyer’ the remainder of the world will start to open up, and when we hit ‘Adronitis’ the prologue is largely finished.
The novel is well thought out and filled with hidden lore, culture, history. So even if my word choice appears random – it’s not. There is a reason why these chapters take as long as they do.
Vermodalen is fantasy adventure, with magic and heroics in an as realistic setting as I could fit. Things are rarely what they seem, and the ugly nature of people bleed through the letters at the turn of every page.
I hope you can give this story a fair chance, even if it isn’t immediately to your taste.

Until, that is, Nintendo releases their biggest game yet- Pokémon Rainbow. An MMO featuring the first five regions of Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh, and Unova, the game draws a massive crowd of players both old and young, longtime fans and complete newbies. The game gets tens of millions of players during its first few days of release.

-History of FBH-
 
Fat Boy Hero is a story long in the making. The idea came from my love of hero stories, but the lack of relatable heroes. By that i mean there were no, or few heroes that dealt with weight gain. Something I have and am dealing with after leaving the Marine Corps. So Fat Boy Hero was born. Check out the link below to listen to an episode of The Round Table Podcast where I brainstormed the idea with the hosts and special guest Michael underwood.

13579,Alviona (undergoing Rewrite).,"This fiction is going to undergo severe Editing and a Rewrite over next few months. Here is what it hopes to accomplish:
1) Fix the glaring issues from Style in every chapter 1-31 (Dialogues, POV switches and Head-hopping too much)
2) Add some new chapters in and justify the development between Sofia and Anita
3) Remove the info dumps and make it more organic
4) Finalize the genres that this fiction belongs to
5) Create warning in the synopsis relating to the contents of the fiction.
6) Overhaul and show what Mira's view on Alviona is (slowly)
7) Introduce new characters
8) Show chapters the way they were intended, as clues apparently were not visible at all!
9) Make Alviona a bit more serious.
10) Make me (Author) enjoy reading my own work more (yes! :))
 
Hi. I have been gone for quite a long while. With heart surgery and such that has happened two months ago, I had not had a chance to log on RR due to being hospitalized. I had some other issues that the admins were kind enough to deal with on this fiction. It's good to see everything in one piece.
The synopsis has been removed. Chapter 1 should be coming out sometimes before christmas. A lot has changed. I hope for the better. Instead of edits, I have re-read every single chapter and found it to be unsatisfying. A lot did not make sense and unless you have previously speculated what Alviona is, many things she does won't fall into pieces. Well then, time to address all of this.
 
Ladies and gentlelmen, this fiction is undergoing a full scale re-write. While the characters and developments stay the same, it's being done differently. So much that the world should feel darker as it should have been.
For those who have stuck around and know the story: Awesome. I worked hard  on this, and hope that you will like my re-write.
For thos that are new: Welcome. Give me some time, as I am super sluggish. I don't know much time is some time, but I gurantee chapter 1 will be up before Christmas.
This said, again, thank you and know that I am back. And that this fiction will be completed. AT ANY COST. I will update synopsis after I post chapter 1.
I might post Alviona (revised, as this current one is far too.... simplified, watered down, and dissapointing version of it) seperately. Those that want this, here. But I don't want to add chapter 40. It won't make sense without the backup and world-building of re-write. It will piss myself off.
Now then, let's write hm?

Is it their facility?
Is it their faculty members?
Or is it the very students that walk its halls and classroom?
Every individual have different answers for that question. But out of all of those answers, the 3rd answer is mostly population’s reply.
And of course that answer is mostly right; the students are the ones that make the school different not by appearance, but by the atmosphere.
A school could feel like a Military-like school or a Christian-like school or even a Prison-like school.
With the students alone can make a School’s atmosphere towards a warm and friendly feeling or a cold and uninviting feeling.

13633,RE: Goblin,"////////////////////////////////////////////////////
The story follows a peculiar man Tom Leer, a lonesome individual with an out-right terrible past. Due to his history, he doesn't smile, nor talk much. Although he was renowned for his intelligence, the people surrounding him defined the guy as having a terrible ""lack of compassion"", and being unreasonably ""cold-hearted"" as well.
On one particularly bad day, Tom was walking along his regular path to work, when, from an open window far above, a flurry of random bricks were dropped.
Tom managed to skillfully remove people from danger in his greatest show of human kindness to date, suprisingly proceeding to dodge the bricks himself !
....but truck-san didn't appreciate Tom stepping out into the street while doing so...
______
 
When Mr. Leer woke up, he came face to face with the most hideous diety in all creation itself. They told him that he would be reincarnated against his wishes, and he wouldn't be allowed to take his ever-precious memories with him. Instead he may retain the 3 traits that defined him during life on earth.
The disgusting higher existence then sent our poor protagonist's soul down to the magical lands of Antasia!
 
Thus, came the birth of the most intelligent, uncompassionate, cold-hearted goblin named Oer.....
 
...wait?
 
...a Goblin?!!!

13636,The Tales of East and West,"These are tales from a land not our own. They are of monsters and men, of dragons and knights, but not in the way usually depicted in fantasy.
In this world, two massive continents are divided by a vast river.
In the West lays the Dark Empire, named thus not for its vile deeds, or visions of world conquest, conquest takes paper work after all and who really likes paper work? But is named instead for the people, or rather peoples, that make up its population.
In the West a Minotaur's only job opportunity isn't guarding some dusty old labyrinth, though there's nothing wrong with taking up the family business, but instead he can be a china shop owner. Where a simple orcish farmer doesn't have to worry about a some rouge dragon stealing his sheep, and is able to sue the living day lights out of the flying rat.
In the East, are the lands called the Many Kingdoms. Home to the lands of Man, the mountain fortress of the Dwarves, and the forest resorts of the Elves. It is a divided, but cultured place, with deep ties into magic, religion, and art alike. Just avoid the back alleys of the city of South Harbor at night, unsavory fellows roam there. Fellows with very sharp blades.
These are the stories of the people of this world, and how they have learned to deal with each other. Like annoying relatives that you can't get rid off, so you just had to learn to deal with them.
[Author's Note: I wrote the first story some months ago for a creative writing class. It went over well with them and my family, who for the pass months have been prodding me to publish it in some shape or form, so here we are.
It should be noted that each ""Tale"" (should there be more) will be a semi-standalone piece(s) that will have some connecting element to the others. Usually
I eagerly await what is thought of my story, and will be appreciative of any feedback, whether it be positive or negative. Though I do ask that it at least be constructive.

I was once asked a question by what you could call a guardian of mine though really she was just a friend.
""If you had the chance to start a completely new life, what would that life be like?""
Quite a broad question I thought to myself at the time. A new life? What would that life be like? I answered this after several seconds of thinking:
""A new life to me would be making everything I've ever accomplished obsolete whether that be good or bad. If I were to start a new life, I would wish not for what I wish in this life, but a completely new experience that I've never known in this life. It could be a battlefield, it could be illogical compared to now, it could be tragedy, it could be loneliness, it could be a fufilling life. I would have my new life let me expierence what I never can now. Does that answer your question?""
""eh.. interesting answer, but vague. I would like to expierence a standard fantasy world overpowered protagonist style.""
""Oi! You asked me not yourself!""
""Ehh too picky.""
""Also that's pretty boring isn't it?""
""Don't crush someone's dreams Shin.""
""Then don't say boring things Karen.""
We laughed at the time of that question but I never thought that question would be answered seemingly by the universe itself.

ALEF is a story of illogical things being sorted logically in an everyday life of his new life. Sure it might have a beginning and an end, but don't all stories have it?  Don't all lives eventually come to an end?

13716,ARIA Online,"L2P, “live to play,” is the tongue-in-cheek tagline of ARIA Online, a new VR-MMORPG that promises to be the most immersive game of all time. Containing an expansive fantasy world said to look ""as real as reality itself"" and a system where character deaths are permanent and monsters level up alongside the players, ARIA Online is certainly poised to deliver. Short of that goal, it at least has everything it needs to become a living, breathing, and truly high-stakes MMO.
But like all good dreams, this one does not last. Less than a day after the game's launch, ARIA Online’s neural network inexplicably goes rogue and locks its connections down. No longer able to log out, and with their very lives tied to the characters they made, ARIA Online’s players find themselves trapped in a veritable nightmare where they must constantly work to outpace their enemies.
Indeed, they can no longer “live to play.”
In this new iteration of the game, they must “play... to live.",87

13723,Magikind [Original],"The third millennia, a time of change and evolution. An era, where people, through countless generations, have evolved strange powers and abilities.
Through several centuries of selective breeding, these beings, known as mages, have become part of the very foundations of society. However, some refused to change or adapt. They believed in purity and refused to interbreed with magikind. Known as the manush, they were a rarity among society.
Now, in the fifth millennia, the manush are thought extinct. With magikind ruling the world, a three-way war grips society. In these uncertain times, a manush called Gin, will herald a new era for all Magikind.
 
A story of how man could realistically evolve while still pushing boundaries.

As a 16-year-old mage from a powerful family, Jayce Candor had known from a young age what his future would hold. As the fourth son in his family the possibility of him becoming the heir to the household was very small. But, with his talent as a mage, his potential accomplishments in the military could lead to titles of nobility and political power.
However, on what would otherwise be an unremarkable night, everything he had ever known, the only people he ever cared for, and all of the plans for his future were destroyed. House Candor, one of the six great houses that helped build the Eldoran Empire had been erased from history.
By imperial decree, all those bearing the name Candor were hunted down and executed as traitors of the Empire. With no home, no family, and only death waiting for him, Jayce decided to escape north to the uncharted Northern Territories to begin a new life.
Forced into situations he was never prepared for and trying to cope with his past, Jayce tries to find safety in a place spoken about only in legends. There for the first time, he will make true friends and find people he will come to see as family. He will encounter strong enemies, build powerful alliances, and become a person his ancestors would be proud of.
But surrounded by creatures he thought only existed in tales and pressed by the Empire’s constant expansion, Jayce’s safety may be only an illusion. To survive a world fraught with danger Jayce will need to grow stronger with each new experience and rebuild his once forgotten house.
 
**********************************************************************
Note: The story starts slow. Although there is more action as the story progresses, there is a fair amount of introspection and character introduction in the first 30 chapters. Jayce is the main character, however, other characters play a large role and the story is seen through multiple POV's. This is a draft, it is not a finished work. This is not a story that focuses on an OP MC who beats up on weaklings. At times there can be a fair amount of internal monologue. Some of that may be edited out when I rewrite the story. I decided to keep it in the draft because I think it is better to have too much material rather than too little when I edit. Constructive criticism is appreciated as it helps in the editing and rewriting process.

In the year 1966, an army of Orishas led by Sango stormed Amadioha’s palace and razed it the ground, starting a decades-long war between two of Nigeria’s most powerful divine orders. Blinded by the rage of battle, the gods did not detect the rise of a third power, far greater and deadlier than anything they could have imagined. When gods, on both the Yoruba and Igbo sides, begin falling mysteriously to their death, Sango seeks the help of Odion, a Lagos teenager destined to rise from his dark past to become a hero. But can a human hero save the gods from a doomed fate?

The Fall of the Gods is an action-packed YA fantasy based on the mythical bond that ties human life with the realm of the divine. It demonstrates the power of stories to change our lives. It also reminds us that Sango and Amadioha are not relics of the past and that, sometimes, what it means to be a hero in today’s world is knowing how to find inspiration in the stories of the gods.

13856,This World of Pure Imagination,"Watch as our hero treks this wonderful world known as ""Imagination"".

Note: This is an amateur work. This is my first story and this book is for practice. This does not mean I will not finish this book or that I am not serious about it though. This story has been on my mind for a while now, but it just hasn't been fleshed out enough in my opinion. This work will be what I use to try and hone my writing skills and I would love it if you could give me input to help me improve.
My Self Reflection (My weaknesses I think I might have):
-POV switching
-Organization
-Comedy might be forced. I try to put my own style of humor into it, but it might not fit that well. I'm sort of an eccentric person and I want to make my characters to be like that because in a world of imagination I think it fits.",0

This is a story of tragedy and the path to ultimate power. All in the hopes of an uncertain survival.

This fiction has NOT been abandoned. I made a haughty promise earlier to not worry because I'll continue this series, and with things lately, I've only proved myself a liar. Further promises dwindled, and I've lost trust. So many things have been going on recently that I've been booked. I will refrain from making any future guarantees or promises as my busy schedule will stay with me for a long long while. Time for me to actually spend on writing and revising won't appear until at the least November 19. I won't say expect that's when I'll restart, but you can expect expecting it to maybe happen.
That's really shallow. But with everything going on, I've let my small reading base down. I apologize. I still stick by my statement though that I won't abandon this project. I plan to stick it to the end, no matter the delay. Most importantly, thank you everyone; readers who both like and dislike my work. I appreciate your time spent on my dumb imagination. Stay toasty my readers in this winter season. Cheers.
 
UPDATE: We're back on track. Thank you for your patience. Any future readers, heyo! Glad you're here.
UPDATE 2: So far it's been 21 days since I last uploaded a chapter. The best thing done for any fiction, no matter how good it is, is that it continues, and I have a bad history with that. 1 fiction on hiatus and already more delays with less than 20 chapters in this fiction. I've been very preoccupied with adding more things to do in my life rather than actually committing to any particular thing. That applies primarily to this.
I cannot abandon this, as busy as my future looks and will look as I get busier and busier. Someday, I hope, I will be able to sit down and just write. just. write.
But for now, I ask for patience. I suppose I'm glad this fiction hasn't picked up so that I don't disappoint too many people if any really. But I need to commit and it's going to happen sometime and sometime soon. 
No more flowery words. I'll see you later.
UPDATE 3: It's very evident I won't be able to pick up this story for a while. With AP Testing, competitions, and other things I am busier than ever.
But I must complete this fiction. I have too.
Until next time.
UPDATE 4: It is now the summer. I owe everyone an apology. Chances are, nobody's around to see this, and that is okay. I only blame myself for this sort of brokenness of a fiction, not that it is actually that bad but I am just exaggerating it for dramatic effect.But what's not exaggerated is the severity of my broken promise. I apologize for my naive claims about finishing a novel that I couldn't finish and that I didn't have the discipline to finish. Nor the skills, really, I was and am still an immature writer.What is to place now? I want to make it clear I understand this is my fault. I will man up to this. And I will accept any criticism. I understand I messed up. Reading Stephen King's On Writing made it clear to me that I need to do two things:Read lots.And write lots.I have done neither. If I don't have the time to read often, how do I expect to write? I need to become more experienced. I need to become a serious writer.So if I want to dream of continuing, I need to at least fulfill both requirements. I enjoy writing. I haven't written seriously outside of school in a while. I planned to write this summer and finish this. I made a lot of promises that I didn't keep.So there's that. I won't enact any self-pity, or be foolishly obsessed. What I did was wrong, and I must deal with it. I let down readers. And I apologize.I hope I can find forgiveness. This is a writer's sin.I won't promise I'll finish this. I intend to finish this, at some point, because writing is fun and I want to write. But how things are don't reflect that. Maybe I'll finish this at some point. Maybe I won't. I won't be naive to make that promise.I thank everyone who has read this if this is the end. If not, and hopefully not, I thank everyone who is to read future chapters. I thank everyone who allowed me to live in the miniscule little dream of mine as I passed my days. I thank everyone who cares enough to read this.
Until next time, peace everyone. Thank you. You are all great readers and great people. I wish everyone the best in whatever reading/writing endeavors follow you henceforth.",33

“To cultivate is to go against the Heavens! No matter how righteous they place themselves, they are nothing more than savage beasts who fear death!”
Those were the words Long Tian’s father always told him. Whether they call themselves Devil Practitioner or not, they are not to be trusted. The hunt for power and immortality exposes the greedy nature of all living creatures.
Long Tian now lives alone after the death of his father makes a living hunting for the village. But fate was cruel and Long Tian died at the hands of a young noble over an unreasonable excuse.
However, the Heavens had plans for Long Tian.
Turmoil from the Heaven’s Realm has caused leakage of Heavenly Qi into the lower realms allowing cultivators to challenge their fate.

13876,K.A.I.S.E.R.,"Synopsis
Total War, Civilisation, Crusader Kings and every other Grand strategy game in existence, gives the player the role of a ruler. They learn quickly that they should not give a shit about their people’s wellbeing unless it somehow directly inconveniences the player with rebellions, unrest, lowered productivity and so on.
The player also learns that the only country that matters in the entire world is their country,  that a successful war is the most wanted commodity,  that being a power hungry maniac that is out to conquer the world and making people worship “My Big Dick” is a fun hobby to do for several hours straight,  that fearing Gandhi is a very justified thing to do.  They learn that backstabbing their allies in the back at the perfect opportunity is a must for any seasoned player.
Especially in Crusader Kings do self-centred sociopathic goals pop up, like “How can I as quickly as possible get rid of my drooling first born child so that my second born genius can become my heir?” or “Who else can I seduce so that I can expand my family so that I can construct additional trade posts?”
This type of character with these self-centred ambitions and self-centred goals that treats everyone else as a tool, obstacle or with indifference is what I like to call the mentality of a Crusader Kings Player.
That is a very rare mentality for a main character in literature. A mentality that wants to actively gain power, construct cities, countries, empires, go to war. This is a type of character who does not react, but acts.
And that mentality is what our main character is the incarnation of.

Sentimental author stuff
This is a story I have been thinking about for over 7 months before I finally decided I should write it down. It was a way to entertain myself and a way to escape to a different universe doing some very difficult times.  This is also a story, I want to write due to the lack of main characters fitting the description of a Crusader Kings Player. (Though Overlord and Warlock of the Magus World are examples of major exceptions)
Please remember, this is my very first story and as such I will make quite a lot of mistakes but I will improve. Usually, I am not satisfied with a chapter after I have written it, but I know the only way to improve is to keep writing.

Name? I carry the names of millions upon millions of souls. Bob, Jerry, Askaram, Sara... 
Race? I devoured the souls of dragons, humans, devils and sentient rocks. 
As I lived... no, perhaps existed is a better world, I absorbed the memories, experiences, forbidden knowledge and devilish arts of many, many damned souls. After all, who could ever roam this forsaken land but the damned?

13898,Re: Dragon ball [Cultivation],"This Story will be in Hiatus because of various reasons;
1st I don’t think I can make this story as good as I would want it to be (At least for now…) I want to write another story so I can have more experience and make this Fanfiction a funny and interesting one.
I always liked to read and watch [Dragon ball], I don’t think is perfect but it is really funny and enjoyable so much that is one of my favorite series, so I think that it would be a waste to make a bad story with the Interesting things that can be made with the combination of [Dragon ball] and [Wuxia].
2nd I messed up a lot of things; release dates, story, etc. [Is my first time trying to write…]
3rd Stupid personal reasons…
I will rewrite this Story in the future…
I will start making a new story and have a few chapters done so that I can at least don’t make the same mistakes again…. Well that’s all… Thanks for the attention…       -_-||

Yìzhì at the verge of collapse could only see everyone running for their lives, pushing him to the ground and afterwards being trampled to half-dead, thinking that the last moments he would see was the glorious battle of powerhouses, he didn’t felt any other regret than not being one of those powerhouses.

While the story is based on the events that occurred during the game, I am taking artistic license for the purposes of turning it into a clear narrative. However, I will try to stick source material as closely as possible since this entire endeavor is to preserve and share the memories of the good times had during the campaign.

These monsters are called mankind.
They are finally betrayed and defeated, but they cannot be killed. They are diminished and stripped of all memory of what they were, locked in a bottle reality on a false world called Earth.
For thousands of years, mingled shards of their Broken Gods continue to chance across the cage that holds the species of their birth. The shards merge with suitable hosts to create empowered archetypes who awaken to supernatural Gifts and fractured dreams of a lost history. The greatest among them are magnificent heroes and villains: The Vigilante. The Mastermind. The Assassin. The Polymath.
This is the story of their inferiors: The Beggar. The Homewrecker. The Gambler. The Henchman. The Miser. The Monster. Together, they will attempt to save the world, free humankind and escape the Cage. This will probably end really badly.

In brief, the world of The Cage is one where humans were once cosmic, reality-bending abominations who plagued the universe. Like many Lovecraftian horrors, the afflictions they caused were usually purely incidental. They simply did not notice the suffering of lesser creatures.
Eventually, they were somehow defeated, stripped of memory, and locked into a false Earth in a false reality.
Pieces of their Broken Gods, once the most powerful among them, sometimes find the prison reality and merge with suitable human hosts. Archetypes with unusual powers are created, based on the qualities or flaws of the Gods from which the shards were made. Primary Aspects include names like the Vigilante, the Polymath, the Murderer and the Mastermind.
The main story has the Beggar, the Homewrecker, the Henchman, the Gambler, the Miser and the Monster as its protagonists.
The short stories here will feature characters that I imagined and wanted to write, but would not fit into the main story. Big names like the Cuckold, the Neglected Wife and the Addict will find a place here. Most of these tales will not be happy.

Today, these ""witches"" number less then a thousand and are being hunted to neigh extinction. In order to prolong their demise and strike back against their foes the mages had to get creative and so they did. In their desperation they created something they didn't understand and used it in a way that only brought death and destruction. They created the beings known as ""Nephilim"".

13973,Infracto Animo,"Pain. Lies. Betrayal. Deceit. Struggles. Sufferings. Humans are an Embodiment of Sin. They Lie, Cheat, Steal, Kill, Threaten, Rape, Betray, and Blackmail. All of this in order to sate their Greed, their Lust, their Envy, their Wrath, their Laziness, their Gluttony and their Pride. As such, Humans go to incredible lengths to achieve their goals. This reaches the point where it can be called ""Inhumane"". But if Humans are an Embodiment of Sin, is there really such a thing called ""Inhumane""? They say ""God created us all equal."" and ""We are equal in God's eyes."" yet why are there many people who are poor, sickly and deformed. Did they do something to be punished as such? Even before they were born? Is there really such a thing called ""Equality""? Is there really such a thing called ""Peace""? Is there really such a thing called ""God""?
This is a story about the pain, struggles and sufferings of a man bound in a loop of never ending hatred and betrayal. Will he break the loop and end his ordeals? Or will he accept his fate and accept the loop? Light and Dark; Good and Bad; Angels and Demons; Abyss or Utopia. What will the man choose? Succumb to Darkness or reach out towards the Light. Now his story begins...
 
This story is pretty grim and depressing with vivid violence (gore on the later part). Sexual content is included but I don't plan on making this an ero-novel so it will just involve rape and (not-so)normal intercourse.

Just a HEADS UP, I am not into satanism or cults or anti-christ but some themes and dialogues here are related to demons and stuff like that so to those who will read this, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

He's the God Of All Trades. He makes pills capable of turning a Mortal into an immortal. He fights demon lords and emperors just because he's bored. When he feels like making a new weapon, he ends up making a holy weapon. Even when he's just planting a garden, he unintentionally make plants that can be consumed to rank up, herbs that can make the highest tier pills, and trees that grows candy that has tons of amounts of energy residing in them. When he raises a baby animal, those animals become the beasts that protects the biggest cities in the world. When he does something, it's always go big or don't go at all. 

He's a God but not one that had to struggle to get to where he is but rather the opposite. He is a God that cheated to get to where he is.

Everyone has to meditate and train all their life just to get stronger but all he has to do is just kill and he gets stronger. He doesn't have to travel around the world in order to find skills, powers, weapons, armors, potions, scrolls, pets, etc. to back up whatever he is going to do. Instead he can just give fake money to a system that others can't see and anything and anyone can be bought.

This is the story of a reincarnated man and a overpowered system which gives him the power of a God and that's not just metaphorically but also literally. This is the story of Shen Zuobi, the God Of Cheat... literally. English Shen Zuobi = Chinese God Cheats.",171
