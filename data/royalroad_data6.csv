14050,Parallels,"Parallels are a constant in life. Our friends' lives often run parallel to ours; we share similar experiences or tastes- perhaps even both. Sometimes, however, opposites attract- and our lives run perpendicular. In that case, we are not attracted by similarities; rather, we are attracted to the differences in others.
So, what happens when two parallels are broken apart? What might happen to them? Are they forever doomed to run alongside each other, never seeing one another, never meeting? Or, perhaps, might they be spun about? Could these lines that formerly ran alongside one another meet? Could they possibly be set perpendicular?
 
 
Any feedback is welcome, so long as it is constructive. Also, you may not use any characters, ideas, places, or what have you that I present here without my explicit permission.
 
A note: This is a story which I began over a year ago, but never got around to finishing- it feels about time to really get it going. Now, there are a couple of things about the story, and myself, that need to be said.
First and foremost, there's a slow start, but by the third-fourth chapter things should be speeding up a bit.
Secondly, in regards to release speed and/or word count per chapter, I make no promises- my schedule is fairly random, and in regards to word count, I will cut off any chapter at any point that feels appropriate to me- that may include cliffhangers, if necessary. I'm not trying to reach a specific word count, I am trying to create a cohesive story, with pseudo-appropriate chapter breaks. This means I will also not rush a half-baked release for the sake of getting a release out.
Thirdly, I will make any edits, anywhere in the story and at any time, that strike me as necessary- typically being wording and/or formatting changes, but I may also decide to change major plot points- in that case I would put a notification in the next chapter released.
Finally, and most importantly, I am a Christian; this story is intended to at least moderately reflect those values.
So, if you particularly dislike any of these things, feel free to look elsewhere, and don't let the door hit you on the way out. God bless, friends.",0

While this premise is something inherent to nearly all stories, what exactly the heroes used to attain success can differ greatly. Perhaps they've trained themselves to the limit, pushing past boundaries nobody else could hope to achieve. Others still, have merely inherited the grand legacy of another legendary being, but what they have done with such a legacy would cause their names to be passed on for generations.

Join the adventure to watch that fear fade away as he realises just how limitless the power at his ‘fingertips’ is. The power of creation and destruction. Of life and death.

Slice of life is fine but without a real goal for the main character I'm having a hard time finding a direction to go with the novel.***
 
Years after biochips have become commonplace, with virtually every living human having one, new advances in technology have pushed a previously ignored bleedthrough effect to affect more than just mental states.
Mike is the leader of a small company, a programmer by trade he's spent most of his life trying to work smarter, not harder. Thinking of this philosophy he jumps into a partnership with famous game developer, ""Where Software"" promising to advance them decades in front of the competition, via chip technology and clever usage of the time dilation effect often used in previous full immersion VR games. After noticing a small clause in the contract which would cheat him of his writes to any software patents he might create, he decides to put in one of his own as a counter offer as a joke and a petty revenge, sure that they'd notice the flaw and amend it so he figured why not, especially if it made them rethink the software rights clause. Fortunately for him and his team the oversight was unnoticed and was accepted. In true programmer style he decides to blame it all on the tester *cough* contractor, whose job is to catch these things.
Five years later the contract is coming to an end, the game and all systems related to it are finished. Deciding to take an early retirement due to the contracts terms being heavily in his favor. He decides to play the game that he's spent so long building auxillary systems for.
 
 
/********************
So guys, this is a heads up, I've never written anything before, ever, not even a fanfiction. However, I've been reading tons and tons and tons of novels on here and frankly, I'm coming close to running out of things I want to read. So getting the idea into my head to try my hand at writing I've been slinging ideas around for god knows how long. I've written and re-written and re-written this first chapter like 7 times deciding on whether I wanted to do VR, apocalypse, transmigration, reincarnation, secret society. All kinds of scenarios, however, to start out I decided that something that might actually eventually happen should be the easiest to write about.
Let me know in the comments/reviews/messages if theres anything that needs to be worked on, as I am new it's pretty much guaranteed that I'm going to fck something up. So let me know and I'll try to fix it asap.
I'll most likely write whenever the need hits me, unfortunately I don't know how often that will be. Just need to get settled in and see how much I'm comfortable with doing every day.

""Oh, we do not want to rule the world at all! We just want to live happy and die happy!""

Why not go the extra mile and become that vicious monarch pounding his scepter at his feet?
This is the story of a young man by the name of Genghis Dillinger Boy. There are quite a few words that can describe Genghis. Anarchist. Libertine. Criminal. Psychopath. He has denied the moral standards society has set for him and constantly lives his life seeking more and more power. Once an unexpected turn occurs in his life, he uses it as an excuse to burn his bridges and move him and his bride to a mysterious island known as Casa do Diaño.

Whilst this is a fanfiction of SWTOR, the setting is VERY different, you will not see any SWTOR characters within this Novel, there will be places both made up and already existing in SWTOR. 
Take for example, whilst the Dark Council still exists, it will have completely different members. 
Also, there are minor changes to the history before and during the Old Republic, but there is little overall change, with the main character starting out at a similar time to a starting character.

Notes on Relation to Lily Ex Machina
While this story is intended to be a sequel to my first work, Lily Ex Machina (LxM), I will be writing it in a manner that does not require readers to have read LxM to understand it. While having read LxM will likely enhance your enjoyment of this work(I hope), I am intending for this story to be able to stand on its own legs. As such, certain worldbuilding elements that I have expanded upon in LxM will likely be repeated in Seeking Elysium(SEly). As such, for newcomers, it should not be an issue to follow this story without prior knowledge of LxM. On the other hand, for my returning readers, I do beg your forgiveness for forcing you to read through stuff you already know. I’ll do my best to try and make it interesting, but no guarantees of success, I’m afraid.
On the other hand, if you’re a newcomer to this series and enjoy SEly, I do hope you’ll take the time to read Lily Ex Machina as well, if only to get more information of the backstories of some characters.

14278,The Red Lands,"The Red Lands
Starting alone from the bottom can be such a pain.
A story of being transferred to a new world.
If you are looking for a shocking OP character, this is not him.
If you are looking for a young master with abundant wealth this is certainly not it.
Maybe a poor slum child with a hidden past and bloodline. Poor yes, dirt poor. Full stop.
Incredible knowledge. Aside from some skills in business, nothing.
This is just a tale of an average individual trying to make the best of what he has.
An average human salary-man was transmigrated into the body of a boy from the slums. What made it worse was that it was a completely different world. Armed with only basic knowledge from his past life and nearly nothing from his present, he strives to survive.
Curiosity can become a deadly driving force for any human being. It all depends on who is wielding it.

AUTHOR'S NOTE: As I went through the other fictions of Royal Road, I noticed that my style of writing style (slow release, 1 big post) doesnt work well in this site. As such, I'll be experimenting on releasing smaller chapters more often, as this seems to be how the authors of Royal Road does things.
Mind you, my release speed will still be very slow compared to others, but I'll churn out chapters more often than what I used to do.

nice to meet you, please call me Star, this is my first novel and I will no doubt make lots of mistakes so please feel free to comment on anything you feel like might help the story. while constructive criticism is helpful I will just ignore trolls or laugh at them so feel free to do the same. I am terrible at spelling and I'm not doing this for profit but as a way to relax so no paid editors. I will warn you that if this book gets impossible for me to write I might just end it, but I will write an end even if it's ended abruptly I hope it won't get that bad though. well hopefully that won't happen, by the way, the ending will be the same it's just the difference of whether or not there are loose ends.
this is mainly an adventure/fantasy, the romance will likely be cringe-worthy with just how slow it will be, either I won't know how to advance or won't want to due to the circumstances I make, on purpose or accidentally. if you have suggestions for story progression feel free to help, I will, of course, give you props if I use them.
Have Fun

It's a curious story where instead of things starting out easy and then progressively getting harder our main character must already find out how to get out of the dead end scenario with next to nothing to help.

The essence of a fist is the desire to strike down those who wrong us and the things we hold dear.

14390,The World beyond the Veil,"This story is deprecated
After this story was published (and a lengthy hiatus), I have rewritten the story from scratch, with both minor and major changes. I have decided to keep the first version of the story here for several reasons. Just know that this is unfinished and a ""better"" version of it, at least in my opinion, exists. 

After witnessing a brutal massacre, Martin's life would inevitably change. He just hadn't expected exactly how much it would change. How much he would change. How different the world really was, beyond the Veil. 

Slightly more in-depth spoiler-ish intro: 


As Martin will learn, magic is real. As for why most inhabitants of Earth was unaware; the very presence of mundane individuals dampens magic around them. That problem, as it turns out, is pretty exclusive to Earth. 



Regarding genre
I find it hard to decide exactly which genres to apply to the story. The ones I have put on the story (Contemporary, Adventure, Fantasy) are the ones I'm certain about. In addition, it arguably contains elements of Drama and Psychological, at least according to their descriptions: 
Drama: Dramatic stories focus on emotional themes and interpersonal relationships. These stories feature realistic characters and their emotional development.
Psychological: Psychological stories focus on the inner action of the characters, including motives, thoughts and emotions from which plot events result. Characterization is particularly important to the story. (...)
On the topic of Gender Bending
There is a gender flip fairly early in the story (Male to female, chapter 7). This is an important aspect of the story that I want to explore with respect. If the very idea of gender-bending bothers you, please feel free to ignore this story. 
As a result, the story has a Male Lead up to chapter 7, and a Female Lead afterward.

It is a case of Sky-Net will not occur because of all the counter-measures and unless someone programs an A.I. to do so, then there will not be a terminator movie coming to life.
Despite with all these advances, society is still stumbling along the second millennium. People live their lives normally like always; going to school, going to work, going to play, chatting from friends… and playing full-immersion virtual reality games with complete-body capsules.
Worldfall Astraea is the newest, most anticipated ultimate full-dive virtual reality roleplaying game in the year 2075. This game is not only for made for normal entertainment, much of the systems are also customized for professional gamers that use and earn real money as well.
This is a story, however, of one special player that had become integrated into the main storyline, giving rise to an epic within the game that intrigues both the developers and gamers alike. The intrigue soon spreads beyond the game and into reality, where a single person, regardless of what others may say, can make a difference.

This can be considered a reworked, off-shoot rewrite of Polaris Dark with a unique style and storyline. One of the other reasons I dropped the Polaris Dark is because it already had a couple of mishaps that felt a bit like a Deus-Ex-Machina. The profession choice and quest line of the main character was also a bit too unrealistic. The main character from Polaris Dark and this story will be similar in their current life but there are very prominent differences in the lives of both.
This is a slow-releasing series as I have much to do for school. Please do not rush my work as it will have no effect on my writing speed and spare time for writing.",13

14423,Sector 27,"It wasn't until June 3, 2101 that World War 4 ended. This was not a war that ended in peace treaties or truces; this war ended with disease. The atomic war caused plague and disease that crippled major countries. The generals and great leaders of the countries at war died from the radiation that penetrated every part of the globe. It was only then that humanity realized what they had done- what they had created. The first ever mutant was publicly executed the very day the war ended, and a new war began: the war against mutants. 
The surviving nation of Japan quickly rebuilt their country by dividing it into safe zones, or Sectors. There are currently 26 livable sectors in Japan; Sector 1 is the richest sector and the only sector that has completely rid itself of all radiation left over from the war. In fear against the threat of mutants, the once small section of the police force grew until it became the main police force in Japan. After all, humans shouldn't be blamed for crimes when the real threat to society is mutants. This police force that goes by their motto: Special Treatment Against Mutants (STAM) is comprised of agents that go about their work to capture and detain all mutants. Sector 26 is the poorest sector that humans can barely survive in; but there is one more part of Japan. This ""dead zone"" has such a high concentration of radiation that if a human were to step inside the barrier, they would die in mere moments. But within this dead zone, this 27th Sector, there lies a secret organization of mutants that fight against STAM and protect all mutants from their grasp. The Mutant Recovery and Protection Agency (MRPA) operates to hide mutants in society and allow them to live human lives. The only thing that stands in MRPA's way is STAM and its agents who hunt them down ruthlessly, so MRPA has their own set of skilled agents. And the battle rages on...",6

-----
""She was tall and lean, with an intricate pattern of scars upon her chest.  Runes, like veins, covered her arms.  There must have been thousands of them, pulsing, filled with magic instead of blood.""
Anael ru'Vorgin had learned many things by the time she turned 19.  She had learned blacksmithing and a bit of weaponsmithing under the tutelage of her father Vorgin ru'Harkovir.  She had learned basic alchemy, and where to find the necessary ingredients for it, from the town healer.  She had become quite adept at hunting, initially by attempting to emulate her older brother Harvin, and later by practicing it while searching for herbs and such.  Yes, Anael has learned many things, but the knowledge she treasures most, despite it's deficit when compared to her other skills, is her knowledge of magic.  She may know less than would be expected of a first year student at the Academy of Sigilry and Elements in the capital city of Balriet, but when her home is attacked and she lies on the cold ground with her blood seeping through her clothes, it is not her knowledge of how to hammer steel which might save her.
 
Author's Note:  I don't have anything particularly gruesome or horrifying, as I see it, in here, but I decided to check the content warning boxes since people's values vary, and there will be a focus on Anael learning more about magic, which will sometimes (maybe often) involve her carving, burning, or tattooing runes and sigils into her skin.  I don't go for gore, etc. for shock value, but I don't really pull my punches either.  I didn't check sexual content, because I have no plans for that, but I also don't promise it won't ever be added, so if that's an issue for you then definitely recheck the tags before reading a new chapter, in case I change my mind once the story gets off its feet.",39

Hello ladies and gentlemen! Welcome to my first attempt at writing a novel. I am preparing to participate in the 2017 NaNoWriMo event so enjoy the first chapter as that's here early only to ensure that I have a place to post once the event starts. This means the first novel/book will have a target of 50,000 words. I'm excited to attempt this challenge despite the hurdles I will have to overcome. I do have a demanding full time job so planning time to write and make weekly releases starting in November will be my biggest challenge.
Also, please accept my apologies on my cover. I'm not an artist and the only digital tool available at my disposal is the stock microsoft paint.

********* Author's Note *********
This is my first published book so feedback would be appreciated. A couple of caveats. First this story is about the details, if you don't enjoy reading and finding the easter eggs or just like to speed read through the chapters you will probably not enjoy it. Second for those that do not like the Harem tag I just want to state that this is going to be a matriarchal society and the women will outnumber the men 5-1. That being the case and because of the culture that I imagine would arise from this I felt it fair to put that tag out there. However, the main character isn't going to be picking up women left and right. This is not a typical harem story.

Author's Notes -
Hello everyone! This is my first work and I will hopefully stay around for a while. I will try to finish or at least expand on this piece of work for quite some time, expect a few hiatuses in between though, still have a bit of schooling to do. Expected release dates will probably be once a week(not sure yet) after I stabilized the novel a bit as I'm still debating on how I should handle this. I prefer fleshed-out works compared to quick releases, but it also depends on how I'm feeling. I don't have a lot of confidence in my writing skills and I believe that my writing style is a bit weird, but I do want to try my best to tell a story that's worth telling. I will gladly accept criticism but please try to pull the punches back a bit! I'm still only human after all. Very excited to work on this, please take good care of me as I proceed on this journey with all of you!
P.S. 
If you're going into my series, expect to see cliches sprinkled here and there. I personally love cliches and a few tropes! But, that goes without saying, I want to put my own spin on them. Be ready to feel the edge!!! Heh.",6

The Magic Continent of Marar is a humongous continent over which many kingdoms rule. It is populated by Humans, Beastman, Dwarfs, Elves, Fairies, magical creatures and various other races. Typical fantasy world, but with no levelling system (to tedious).
Synopsis:
The story follows the adventure of a boy/man (he grows older in the story) named Ankou. Born in a small and remote village to the east of the Tharon Kingdom located in the west of the Magic Continent of Marar. One day before Ankou's 5th Birthday the village gets attacked by bandits who massacre his whole village and burn it to the ground. Ankou at that time was oblivious to this fact, as he was playing in the woods north of the village with a magic creature double his size, strangely though he wasn't attacked, despite the creature being the most savage magical creature in the entire kingdom. What will he do next, when he finds out that his village was raided?

This will be my first fiction story and I hope you give me some advice in writing and rate my story and leave critique in the comments aswell, so I may improve myself. I write out of pure fun so updates will be when I have time and lust to write something. English is my second language so I hope you have some understanding if the grammar is incorrect or might have used some words wrongly. IF, a big IF, IF names are the same as in works of others, that is not intentionally so, but i found the name cool and used it and it has nothing to do with others work.

Author's Ramblings
Hi everyone! Thank you for taking the time to read my synopsis. It really doesn't have anything to do with the story but change is in the story so I guess it sort of has some meaning. I was also thinking of what to write for my synopsis that related to the title and it just came to me, so I went with it...
I am a novice writer and I love reading the stories that have been posted on this site so I decided to try to create my own. I did try once before but I didn't really like it so it was scrapped. Hopefully I do better this time and you all enjoy my work. 
I will try to post chapters at least once a week but I may not always be able to do so.
Please let me know if I made any mistakes with spelling or grammer. I usually check but who knows what might slip through.
If you could leave a comment on how to make my work better, I will try to improve in that aspect.
The content warnings were selected as I may include gore and sexual content in my story though I'm not positive. Profanity will most likely happen.
Once again, Thank You for reading!",2

God against god, brother against sister, mother against father, and even took the lives of many innocent people, some human, and some who weren’t. As a precaution to something similar happening ever again, the gods decided to split one world, into multiple, separating it off into worlds of different elements, races, and sealed Umbra onto an unknown planet.

Why are they in human form? There is a reason but all will be explained as the Chronicles of the Wanderer unfold.
Classic quests in a modern setting with no humans, a hero who doesn't know his own name and whose proudest achievement was being taller than Tom Cruise but who is the key to the survival of the peoples of Dunrealm and all set in the Lake District of the UK and all with a smattering of humour and plenty of bad language.

Regardless, being human isn't what's important right now.  What if you were given a chance to live a new life as a different person?  A different race? A different planet? A different reality? Would you agree to it?  
Annoying, huh. So many questions you have to consider, but you don't really need to think too much about it. I clearly didn't. Not like it mattered, it all went well in the end. Technically.
Reincarnated into a virtual reality. Sounds weird, probably because it is. I agreed to it, so did a few others, wasn't much of a problem to any of us. But that doesn't mean we don't other problems, does it? Look at me, acting all mysterious.

14616,The Egg Guardian,"First and foremost, I must apologize as this story is currently on an indefinite hiatus. School, work, and writer's block have gotten in the way. I was rather unprepared when I began posting this and kind of just did it on a whim. Thus, I shall ensure I am thoroughly prepared before posting anything else, but I plan to return to this someday to continue it.

Heaven thinks hell is getting a little lukewarm and Berrick is just the guy to heat things up again. Follow Berrick as he works for home and hell as one of the few Egg Guardians.
Author's note:
Are you looking for bad writing, terrible dialogue, short chapters, and slow releases? Then you've come to the right place! This is honestly just something I'm writing for fun and figured I'd publish while I'm working on my main project, but I always appreciate constructive criticism so I can improve.

14620,Mod to King,"This story is the traditional video game character made real in another world. However it has a couple differences.
First the main character in question hails from the US in the year of 2029. So this world makeup is relatively the same as our modern time. It is just set a decade into the future where virtual reality has become a marketable product.
Second the main character hails from a mod of the vr-mmorpg Roundscape. A ""mod"" is basically a hacked version of a game. Think of these as being in the same mold as the Elder Scrolls franchise.
Think of the Roundscape game itself as if one of those old school rpg games incorporating many elements found in the D&D franchise.  But the game still has that old Final Fantasy feel to it - just in a VR setting. 
The story will read from the first person point of view (usually from main character) in the past tense but in concurrence. What this means is events of the story are happening in the present but the character in question is speaking of it as though it already happened. This is just a personal preference in writing style.
In terms of summarizing the story overall - it is the classic overpowered main character in a power fantasy setting.  I would say this is a +18 story but do not expect really detailed scenes or even gory gory scenes.  It is a bit ""haremy"" but not full on of that genre.  And do not expect this as a /hentai series but there will be lines indicating provocative scenes are happening.
The story overall has a dark edge but it is not about a guy who is full on evil.  It is more about a main character who toes that line and how his mere presence can affect everything around him.  I would describe him more as an anti-hero or an apathetic villain.
 
Please keep in mind this is just a hobby of mine done in the little spare time I have and even this first chapter is still a work in progress.  So do not expect daily or weekly updates.  I hope I can push this as a monthly installment.
But I do thank you for your time for reading this and I hope you enjoy it :D

The ancient cities of man crumbled, the forests and the beasts died, the oceans boiled and hell descended; that was how things were meant to end. And where was humanity when this happened? Where were the keepers of earth? Once again humanity chose to do what it did best. When you cannot not fight, when you cannot not run; you hide and you wait and one way or another you survive. 
  They built a new city, like none that had been before, a city that existed in absolute silence; well almost. A gentle hum surfused it all, rising in defiance of the quiet, the last embers of life amid the cold streets of machinery. There they were: the last remnants of humanity, an endless stream of ones and zeroes sequestered in their iron highrises, in endless databanks and supercomputers raging in the ashes of the earth. A digitsed humanity living within a binary world. A world filled with impossible things pulled from the forgotten legends of humanity, monsters and dragons, and treasure, love and war , and of course heroes: Super heroes, to defend the day and drive off the night, symbols of hope and peace and survival. 
  But where there are heroes there must be villains.

About author:
I am new to writing stuff in general. I will probably have lots of grammar mistakes since English is not my first language. I am writing as a hobby. I release atleast one chapter a week. I planned volume 1 to be about 60-70 pages in my google doc. 
Character inspiration from myself. I literally have a brain that does not shut up. 
I do enjoy a lot of novels here especially : savage divinity and paladian. 
The cover page is my own design. I am happy with it, but feel free to suggest/show something better. I will try to do an art of my characters, especially Trevor, so you guys can also see what I see. But that will take a while. In the meantime, keep reading!",17

Nico entered The Nature's Bane course to hopefully one day become one of the 10 Lords and take down whatever Mother Nature has in store to destroy humanity.
There is one problem, his Affinity for most Magic is zero. The only thing that allowed him to pass the Entrance Exam was his unheard of Affinity for the relatively unknown Soul Magic and his inhuman physical abilities. These specialties barely got him into Class F, which is considered the weakest of Nature's Bane and has never had any students actually make it into Nature's Bane.

THE 7 REALLY IMPORTANT STUFF

Clichés shall be avoided like the cancerous tumors they are.
The world shall not spread its pink butt cheeks for the main character’s convenience.
No character shall be thinner than one slice of white American cheese.
No female character shall serve to highlight how overpowered and fabulous the main character is.
No villain shall serve to highlight how overpowered and fabulous the main characters are.
Grammar laws shall be upheld sometimes.
I, the author, swear not to be a prick. I, the author, swear not to go away without warning.

A few warnings and things to note:
-I've put up the tramatising content tag due to a lot of mentions on death, dying, illness, and a mother who tends to be rather cruel.  I know that I take a perspective that many will strongly disagree with, and I'm okay with that.  Just be warned that this isn't lighthearted stuff.  This is real, and death is real, and this part streaches beyond the fiction into reality.
-I'm going to say a minor spoiler, but I don't want it to take you unaware because it is something to be aware of.  




 At one point, my MC attempts suicide and fails.  It's a very violent scene and I will put up the gore tag after writing this, and it's also just really depressing.  If this will be triggering, you need to be aware of this before you read it.

14806,Cinder Souls II,"Dark Souls is known as one of the hardest game series to have ever existed and with the third installment of Dark Souls, being Dark Souls 3, the makers of the game decided to not make another. With the licensing of the game being put into limbo, a game company called Virtual World decided to buy the right to make another game in the series, this game was called Cinder Souls.
Something was different about this game compared to the rest of the series and that was it is on the World Gear, a device that put your consciousness inside of the game and gave you complete control of your character's body. This game exploded and sold over 5 million copies in the first week since it had something other games didn't. Freedom. You could do 18+ actions, take over kingdoms, destroy guild bases entirely, and even rob NPCs.
Of course there are laws in certain areas that prohibited certain actions but that all depended on what guild was in control of the land you are at. There are 4 continents with there being several countries dividing each continent into different sections and each having their own difficulties. The strongest continent of them all is Land of the Gods, which only the most legendary of players can enter and become apart of. It is a small island which only has 10 inhabitants but these 10 people could easily take over any other continent on the planet but decide to lay dormant on the island, waiting for something strong to spice up the game. Each of these 10 players is considered a God in the game and even have their own following base. Each God had major influence over the millions of other players in the game but that was all in the past. Now it is time for an update, a completely new world with new enemies and new beginnings for all and that update is coming soon. Its supposed to arrive in one day in fact. 
This update would have new quests and new adventures and the game title will be changed to Cinder Souls II, whether you kept your character or not is unknown but what was known was that the real world was excited for this. Since it was an update, you didn't have to repurchase the game so old players began to dust off their old copies and prepare for the copious amounts of fun in store for them.
This story follows one of the best players to have ever graced the game, Frew, the God of Miracles, and his new adventures but it is not as expected. Not one of the 14 million players could expect what would be coming up next in Cinder Souls II nor would anyone be prepared for it.
*****WARNING, IF YOU ARE HERE FOR THE VIRTUAL REALITY ASPECT IT IS NEXT TO NONE EXISTANT EXCEPT FOR CHAPTERS IN THE FAR FUTURE*****

14979,Birth of an Immortal Ninja,"Well as all reincarnation stories go. Someone has to die for it to be a rebirth, I just happened to be that person. Though I was not expecting something like this to happen after I did.
Currently only doing chapters when I feel like it. I hope to soon get to atleast 1 or more a week at a minimum. Prologue length will not be the normal chapter length. I plan to have chapters be around 3k-5k words each. This is not counting tables or the ending statistics of the main character.
Still choosing a cover. PM me if you find one that might fit the story that will not have copywrite issues.
Synopsis is under revision till I get far enough into the story to have a decent one.
(I do not own a majority of the abilities in the point shop that the character can access. All of the owners work belongs to them not me. I will not be earning anything off of this webnovel. I will not even accept donations at this time. Once I make my own novel that is based solely on my own work. Only then I might change this.)",11

14981,Jack at World of Syntaria,"Story Completed! (Not sure how to tag as complete yet)
 As one of the five chosen heroes in the other world, one has mistakenly chosen utility skill...
A cooking skill which all housewives normally have.
Our protagonist request a little wish because of his weak constitution ""if I only have at least... cough*! cough*! a healthy body""
An unknown world, without a powerful skill, whats more...a baby?
Conquering world from start not as heroes but as civilian... 
Note: It's a Light hearted story",89
14982,Worlds of battle,"In a world where the strong rules and the weak suffers, countlest creatures fight for supremacy, and many long for the top of the world but only few succeed.",3
14983,Stay Human,"Synopsis:
The end has come for the people of earth, and only the strong will be granted the rights to try and survive, as those assessed by the system as too weak mentally are turned into monsters.
Annabelle and Samuel were born from different parents.
Brought together in their early childhood as siblings, they had only each other's company to save them from complete insanity in the abusive environment growing up. Some noticed that they were special children growing up; Samuel being able to grasp a human's thinking and manipulate it at his convenience and Annabelle, who made people lose their souls to her young beauty.
Watch these two slightly twisted siblings as they grow in the apocalypse, depending on each other and becoming legends at the end of the world.",11
14984,[HIATUS] Dragon Scythe Online,"-ON HIATUS. SORRY FOR THE SUPER LATE WARNING BUT I'M WAY TOO BUSY AT THE MOMENT TO KEEP UP WITH THIS. REST ASSURED, IT WILL BE FINISHED!-
""We used to fear the Dragon God... and now we fear the one who saved us.""
 Three young men take their first breaths in Dragon Scythe Online; a knight, a wizard, and a rouge, but all come from outside the world. All three meet mysterious outsiders from outsiders more like them than they know, and all have different goals and explanations as to why they are there.
As they quest separately for the legendary Blade Against The Titans, The Dragon Scythe, it becomes readily appearent that some players of this game are more real than others; far more real. When blades are turned player against player, how will the three survive this dark world and come to terms with who they really are?
This is a sci-fi fantasy novel with very heavy LITRPG themes. Expect a humorous exterior with a dark twist later on. If you're good with multiple MCs and interconnecting plotlines, then you have found a good read.
*In current hiatus until I finish book two in my rebooted fantasy series on amazon, details to follow soon.*
Note: big cameos from other Inkrealm Universe characters. The story can be enjoyed without reading the other novels in the universe, but do be aware.",27
14985,Re:Cold Magic War,"A Rich Young Man Had A Dream Of Becoming An Actor But One Thing Was Missing He Was An Ugly Man And He Couldn't Live With His Ugly Face And So He Committed Suicide,After He Died He Was Granted One Wish And He Used This Wish To Be An Actor He Became An Actor But The World Was All Messed Up.",0
14986,Protection of the Vheil – Re-integration,"The Vheil has protected us for the last 250 thousand years, somehow it has been forgotten and all our stories of monsters and myths have gone from fact to fantasy. We should have been preparing. We should have remembered. Now the Vheil is gone and the System is back in control, with it comes all the good and the bad.
A fantasy LITRPG writer lays in his hospital bed as the system comes back online, an 87 year old man, Unfortunately he dies, while the integration is in progress. But his luck must be astounding, as instead of his soul going into the sea of souls to be clensed and reborn, the systems calls for a soul while the sea is locked for reintegration, in the .00000014 seconds that it is locked his soul is the only soul availible for a newborn, born on the same moment he had died. 
This is his story, be it long or short, Heroic or Villianous.",13
14987,The Dungeon Chronicles,"This is the story of a dungeon core, starting from the very beginning of its existence. Our dungeon core may end up as a valuable resource to all humans, or he may become a creator of hoards, destroying everything in its path. This is The Dungeon Chronicles.

A choice to start your life over, in a body that actually responded to your attempts to move it.
A choice to escape from the cruel world that would not listen to your pleas for help.
A choice that would give you the strength to continue your existence and then some.

What would you choose?",2

We write the year 2005 of the gregorian calender. Mankind had just discovered their first Alien Brother. A parasite species called 'the Guardians'. After a short time of peace and euphoria, the humans had become accustommed to their new friends. Continuing their casual lifes as usual. That was, until the Guardians realized their compatibility with human bodies and started feeding upon them so that they could grow their own population.
After the widder human public had found out about this situation, anti-Guardian sentiment grew upon them, and peaceful solutions were thought after. 
Though, in the middle of the peace talks, Guardian forces attacked San Francisco, destroying the city entirely and killing millions in an instant. As a response, the US Government formed the Red Wing Initiative. A military unit tasked with taking down the Guardians. But, because of the Guardians usage of memory manipulating gas, they were able to take control over huge portions of the US population. Dividing the country in half and putting the people up against each other. This lead to the destruction of Red Wing, and an end to the human rebellion against the Guardians.
Mankind continued their lifes as usual, no longer remembering their alien brothers, and the Guardians continued to rule upon them from the dark.",1

If there is errors please say me I'm French so it's possible for me to do some.
If you want to mess with the plot of the story, just read at the end of the text.
So, here is the synopsis :
There is a world divided between two gigantic powers: the Empire, and Nyggloth. The first have a control over an entire continent of tens of thousands of kilometers wide, the second, is a 3,000 km wide island!
The Empire is full of gods, heroes and powerful mages.
The only reason the Nyggloth is able to resist to the Empire is because of one man: Merlin.
100 years ago, an unknow continent, Khan, until now hidden, was revealed to the world. It was like the population of the continent disappeared... On it, entire cities, skyscrapers, and futurist buildings... And Merlin. Merlin was not only the only one who knows technology and how to use it, but also was extremely powerful in magic. Having no choice, Nyggloth accepted an aggreement that stated that if Merlin protect Nyggloth, then half of the power will be ceded to him. After ten years of battle, Nyggloth unexpectedly won the war...
Today after 90 years of peace, nothing happens between Nyggloth and the Empire... Until our MC, Moar, show up, and do about everything he wants.

Soldiers from the south bearing green cloaks and royal seals maintain order in the streets of Bleakridge, ensuring that the lifeblood of commerce continues to flow through the port city.

There has been a major edit of the first 11 chapters, so anyone who enjoyed the story but couldn't take the spellchecker and other grammar mistakes should give this another shot. I can’t promise that there will be no grammar mistakes, but they will be less common and far less egregious.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________
Notes. First for those of you looking at the fact that this story has both the Harem and Female Lead tags I am pleased to relieve your concerns, or disappointed to inform you depending on your tastes, this will not be a reverse harem, Chloe has no romantic interest in boys. Second, I was hesitant to add the Anti-Hero tag, but Chloe certainly dances on that line. Just to prevent any misunderstandings, even when blood and treachery abound and Chloe is at her most amoral this will primarily be a light hearted story.",182

This is my first novel and as you had expected from the title, it's a xianxia novel.

15097,The Darkness Inside,"My name is Miles Lawson, and I am 26 years old. Every day I answer some of the stupidest, most inane calls known to man. I'm supposed to be cheerful and happy to assist you when you’re a fucking moron who puts your laptop in the oven to dry it off when you spill something on it. I doubt I will have my job much loner though, five years ago a chip was invented that allows the human mind to interact directly with computers, so laptops and desktops are becoming antiques. They estimate that eighty percent of people in the United States will have the implants installed in the next five years so at some point I will get shit canned. In the meantime, though I have to stay positive and cheerful when I really want to just tell you to fuck off.
In my off time, I play games. I enjoy the freedom they give me for a few hours a day. So when I saw the advertisement for Everlife, I knew I had to get myself an implant and get the game when it was released. I have another day to wait, but I scheduled to take off from work for my two-week vacation. With the 8x time dilation that will round into around three months of gameplay depending on how often and how long I have to log off.
Welcome to Everlife, the first of its kind Full Immersion Virtual Reality Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game ever.  In our world, you can do anything you want through an extensive quest system controlled by our exclusive AI that customizes quests based upon the individual actions of the players and translating that into custom stories that tie into other player’s stories which creates a totally custom play experience that is unlike any other.

This is a story that is a multiversal story, with separate series with the title ""Sekai"" within the name. Each verse in this Sekai realm are stories that completely change Hartea's character and the world and setting the Sekai in which is this one originally was in.

After being poisoned, he awakes to find himself in a game-like fantasy world! Something he has frequently fantasised about.
Robbed of his inheritance in his former life, he will receive a much greater inheritance in this one.
Note: This is my first attempt at writing, and it may have some stiffness and inconsistency as I get used to things and discover my own writing style. I will likely be going back and revising things, as I'm making it up as I go. The MC is largely based on myself (William is my middle name), and this novel will undoubtedly contain some wish fulfillment. There will be explicit sexual content in the future. I also can't promise consistent updates, as I write when I feel like it. Constructive criticism is welcome, haters will simply be ignored.
Here's hoping some people enjoy it.",75

AUTHOURS NOTE
My native language is English but this is my first story so please give me any suggestions you want (if their good enough I will try to include them) and point out any mistakes in my story or writing.
The story will have dark humor with elements of many different genres of fantasy but tying them together in a cool fun way (at least I will try). No haram or cliché elements I promise. (like bad guys being bad for no reason or all characters have zero motivation for anything they do)

Maximilian Everett missed the initial release of the game. Once he had it though, he found that Aldemoor's AI had a lot more planned for him than he expected. Delving into the mystical, Max finds that there is certainly more to this world than what appears on the surface.
Aldemoor is my attempt at the litrpg scene. I tried before with my first story on here but it wasn't on this level.

15167,The Limits of Limitless,"Author's Note: So, new author here, nice to meet you from this lovely one sided conversation lol. I was so tired of waiting for the perfect story for me so I decided to write a few of my own. These are basically just to make me happy, but if you enjoy them too that would make me happy as well lol. ______________________________________________________________________________________
So once upon a time, there was a convienent, and slightly cliche, plot device used by a somewhat lazy author.... Which in turn, created an easily made story of how a lucky high schooler posing as a hardcore gamer dies only to resurrect in a fantasy reality, meeting beautiful women, powerful dragons and ancient beings, an assortment of insanely escentric fellows, and a certain over powered ring. Journey with them as they explore the wilderness of twisted imagination.
Or for you old timey folk who like their synopsis a bit tame, here you go: Jason, a senor in highschool, is slowly failing school due to not giving a fuck. Like many people now in the year 3056, he is obsessed with the wonderful invention most lovingly called, 'True Virtual Realities'. now by using his obsession with his favorite Virtual Reality game called 'Reality Controlled', which is the first and so called best Virtual Reality ever made. it was basically the all around escape humanity wished for, and he with heaven defying luck came across one of the three cheat items the game developers left for themselves: The Limitless Ring. The ring was a support type item and had the ability to grant wishes, store worlds, clone items, grant skills and easily learn abilities. But those are just a few of the things it could do. Using the ring he successfully became the ""best player"" and had a herd of fans following him everywhere. It was a dream come true. Until, he was killed from a power surge that fried his brain which was hooked up to the Nerve Capsule, an unsafe prototype of the Dive gear that he bought do to low funds. The end. Or so you would think....

Minutes into the experiment, his soul was damned, as the ritual accidentally sealed his very essence into the stone golem.

15211,Elevator City,"Bagnatis Vo slumps his way back from work after another long day before literally stumbling upon a mysterious package. Unable to leave it sitting, the young man tears it open to find an unnanounced sequel of a favourite game from his childhood. Rushing to play it, Vo is left reeling as he realises he's in for an experience more elevated than he had bargained for.



With a city reeling from its eighth failed raid, the citizens grow wearier as casualties pile up and quakes get larger. Titans cement their hegemony over the city in preparation for the ninth, crushing smaller cloisters with their influence or their boots. With gods usually worshipped demoted to a status easily discardable, how will a man find his place when even a god might not. How will he climb past the rest, and bring the city with him? While everyone else is looking up, he might just find the answer below them.



So I had this idea of a city with gods a long time ago, before Danmachi was a thing and isekais, or portal fantasies, were a bit of a more niche genre. But I sat on my ass and as mentioned, Danmachi came out. I felt like their city was far more flush with life and was a bit embarrased to post my story all of a sudden in the fear it would be seen as a copy cat. That's fine, there can be more than one city with gods. Hopefully, mine will stand out for other reasons though. :)

15213,The flame of fate,"Ah... the fallen Kingdom Of Vireweth, many years have passed since someone asked me about that.
Spoke the old man as his flowing beard rippled slightly with his movement.
""why do you want to know about that? There are few things i know about it and none of it is good ""the cursed land"" they call it for a reason.""
The old man shifted as he looked at the person sitting across the table, he wore a well worn leather armor that was covered in a tattered dark gray robe, most likely it was another color when made. His face could not be seen clearly as the hood was pulled down and covered everything but his mouth that had a short unkempt beard growing around it.
"".. why i want to go there is far too complicated to explain right now, nor do i want to explain it anyway, all i want is to know where is the old road that leads to it. ""
Staring at the man across him intently for a few seconds the old man finnaly let out a long sigh as he spoke,
""Very well..then listen carefully for its a complicated and dangerous journey to the old road """,0

15218,The Road Not Taken,"Left or right? Up or down? Backward or forward? 
Life is a branching road, laden with mysteries and qualms. New opportunities arise with every step we take, and with opportunities come decisions. As Sartre once said, ""We are condemned to be free."" Pitted against the infinities of choice, we must choose a single path -- a single life -- and reject all others.

Elijah Frost had long been averse to change: every day consisted of the same activities, diligently repeated without question. He'd wake up each morning, go to class, return home, and sleep. His classmates thought he was just shy, while his parents labeled him emotionless. And, for the most part, they were both right -- only one emotion pervaded Elijah's mind, and it was extreme boredom. His childhood dream was to explore the world, but his fear of change slowly overcame his desire for adventure. Unable to take the first step, he waited and waited, until finally, his chance arrived. Now, all that keeps Elijah from his dream journey is a couple of decisions: some small, some big, but all exciting and new.

Join Elijah on his adventure, participating in every choice he makes! You'll not only be able to vote on which path he takes, but also suggest different ones. There is no master plan for this story -- it's future will change with every poll. Tag along and find out where Elijah ends up!
Genres and tags are subject to change as the story progresses.

15225,Sod's Law (Dropped),"This fiction has been dropped, you're more than welcome to read it anyway (there is sort of an ending). But you have been warned...

Sod's law is a more extreme version of Murphy's law. While Murphy's law says that anything that can go wrong, will go wrong (eventually), Sod's law requires that it always goes wrong with the worst possible outcome.
For example, concepts such as ""bad fortune will be tailored to the individual"" and ""good fortune will occur in spite of the individual's actions"" are sometimes given as examples of Sod's law in action. This would broaden Sod's law to a general sense of being ""mocked by fate"". In these aspects it is similar to some definitions of irony, particularly the irony of fate. - Definitions of Sod's Law on Wikipedia.
The protagonist, as many before them, and many who followed, thought they were just entering a VRMMORPG (Virtual Reality Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing-Game). Unbeknownst to them however, was a short paragraph in the Terms & Conditions, that, upon agreement, would actually transport them to a fantasy world, loosely based on the game they thought they were entering. - Something anyone could be forgiven for, no-one reads them after all.
In this new world, they discover that people are born with “Traits”, a System recognised, ability, skill, or talent, that they are born with. Sod's Law was not a trait they, or anyone else for that matter, would want. 
Pure madness follows.
Yup, this is about a character transferred to a fantasy game-world with the worst luck imaginable.
This is my first fiction so I apologise for any grammar and spelling mistakes that may be made. Hopefully it is readable, and if so please tell me! But if it's not, also tell me, but in a constructive way if at all possible?
Due to the nature of the “Trait” the story will be dark in places, with plenty of gore and profanity, hence the tags. There may also be scenes of a sexual nature, but nothing full on – sorry guys but you'll have to go elsewhere for that.",62

Or will he go down in a blaze of foolish glory like the ikemen before him?>> This novel is now dead. It will no longer receive updates. <<

As the high priest saw this, he heaved a sigh as he put his own body down onto the altar, took out a knife, and stabbed his own heart with a strangely peaceful look on his face.

Repairing any small defects, preventing almost all non-genetic abnormalities that can occur pre-birth. In less than 10 years nanites were transmitted knowingly and unknowingly to every single person on the planet, even those in 3rd word countries with little to no access to technology were now able to enjoy one of the most technologically advanced pieces of machinery known to man.
Allen is a retired Sergeant from the Air Force. When news of a virus spreading through the nanites makes it public he thinks very little of it. It's barely a concern, a patch will be implemented and it will be removed. At least the virus seems to be benign. Months pass, the virus is gaining more and more momentum, a status bar is shown to every infected, moving slowly at first, months for a couple % infecting more and more at an exponential rate. When Allen gets infected he's a little annoyed but theres not much he can do except wait for a patch and deal with an annoying status bar hoving in his vision.
Things change quickly though. The status bar hits 25% what took hours to get a few percent before takes seconds, before he knows it the bar fills to 100%.
Phase One Begins.

A Level 5 Orc Wanders Into The Forest...
 
Lured by limited-edition legendary loot, players have flooded into the virtual reality MMORPG ValorVale. Not that Cal cares. Wheelchair-bound by an incurable disease, he's playing just to experience walking again. Not even the glitch that has forced him to play as an Orc will stop him.
 
Armed with a hatchet, he grinds and levels up in his own little corner of Terrafaytum. Casting newly acquired Earth Craft, he helps a winged warrior moments from death escape from a tribe of bloodthirsty Werejaguars. With this, the gears of fate clunk into motion.
 
Cal becomes trapped in ValorVale, unable to exit the game. Looking for answers, he accepts a mission that will take him deep into Dresham, where an usurper sits atop the throne. Terrafaytum will be torn asunder if a hero doesn't rise. Problem is, it's chosen a level 5 Orc to be its saviour.",18
15279,RECALCITRANCE,"{COMPLETED}
Alaina wishes to be more than a mere icon for her kingdom, believing a princess should be much more than a fragile lady in a dress. The king wants no more than for her to marry in order to succeed the throne, but she has other things in mind -- such as her thirst for freedom and adventure.
But when one of the neighbouring kingdoms demands that it's time for a change in the land of Asteria, her entire kingdom is shaken. To worsen the situation, the king is somehow caving in to the demands irrationally. Stubbornly refusing to resign herself to the kingdom's seemingly inevitable fate, she is forced to leave her home in search for the root of the problems.
Along with people of diverse backgrounds she comes to trust and a hotheaded boy with pyrokinesis named Kai, Alaina joins an uprising rebellion against the forming empire. But the rebellion is only the beginning of the end, for the end result isn't as perfect as how they have proudly perceived and imagined it to be - some sacrifices are destined to be made.

15301,The Fascinating Tale of Mathias Silver [DROPPED],"ON AN INDEFINITE HIATUS UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE
Mathias Silver had always been a quiet, well-behaved young man. Living a daily routine that would take him to and from work, with his day always ending the same way, comfortably in his loft, until one morning when he had overheard something about a dead girl, killed by a man who the police had given the name 'Night Hunter'. He decided to investigate, as the good samaritan that he was, only for things to spiral out of control. 
Join Mathias Silver as he descends further and further down the rabbit hole. 
 
--------------------------
The synopsis is still heavily being worked on. This story is still in its semi-development phase and only has a few chapters ready for submission. More chapters will quickly follow - once a week on average. I will still be continuing my work on the Inquisitor story, for those of you who follow me for that, with another chapter(chapt.10) coming out in a week or so. I just wanted to get started on this second story while the idea was still fresh in my mind. I plan to test my skills and go above and beyond what I'm comfortable with for this story. The title may be slightly altered later on, but so far I'm satisfied with how things are developing.

Pronunciation:
Mathias pronounced 'mah-TYE-us', but can also be pronounced 'mah-THYE-us'.

Last, final word.
The Fascinating Tale of Mathias Silver will seem extremely boring at first, and even the first chapter is quite rough. I understand this, that's how it's supposed to be. You're taking a look at a man's life as he lives through a boring and meticulous routine. 
This is an original story, and will absolutely earn it's genre tags. If you've picked up the story on day-one, make sure you return often for the continuation.

Instead, she's recently become addicted to the PVP battle royale game, Melee of the Ages, and the thrill that accompanies it. A ruthless player who will do anything to win, she aspires to climb the highly competitive ranked ladder of the game and one day become its top player. In order to gain MR (Melee Rating), she has to perform well in more games than she performs poorly. The quickest way up, however, is winning games and being the last man standing. 
Though it was originally diagnosed by her psychiatrist as an outlet for her violent impulses, it only makes her worse. Follow Emma as she attempts to overcome the challenges of living with a mental illness, as well as those that she will encounter on her journey to reach the top.

If there was a God, and conclusively it seemed there was, well, he didn’t take charity and he knew there was no penance for genocide, for no right can undo a wrong, for even if you heal one-hundred thousand, the glassy eyes of a small girl lying along a river bank with a crimson stream feeding the fish, her parents hung above her, that never will leave you. He knew,.. it never had.
As opulence surrounded a poor man, he went to his desk and wrote the last thing he would write in this world, and if there was another,.. perhaps he would no longer be the man he became. A sigh escaped his lips and the quite sound of a quill scratching on paper stopped every-so often for the need to dip the tool, for that’s all it was, just like man, a tool to be used then,.. no he needed to think not as he was but whom he remembered, and wished to be like.
“The last memoir of Lothal Smith~ Let the last memory of me be used in textbooks, papers and for those who are learned to teach those who are not the one simple truth, in my wealth, my kingdoms, my harems, and my vain appearance there is and was no joy, for man has always searched for acceptance, but I would cation you to look instead for those things that cannot be taken from you, peace, serenity, joy, and memories of love. For all my life, I have found and sought lust, wealth, and power. It brings a deeper emptiness after the deed is said and done then you can possibly imagine. Though there are and will be those like me who cast off the wisdom of those who were before I pray you return to words of wisdom in your age, and hope you live long enough to do so.

Despite the goddesses' warnings, he persisted. Hence, the goddess gave Hiromi a small mirror and said to look into it when he was ready.

For almost two hundred years Sentient AI research has been banned.  Everyone knew this, and yet no one has ever given up on finding the perfect setup for it.  Restricted AI are rare, but possible to get ahold of if you have the money and the clout to get through the law for it.  Especially when it deals with the military.
Alfred Homis is an engineer and has spent the last three years working for the United Terran Military's Research and Exploration Department.  Specifically to help build a 'shackled' AI who's prime directive was to explore potentially habitable worlds.  Worlds that are far cheaper to colonize and add to the United Terran Directorate's fold than terraforming.
During the AI's maiden voyage things go horribly wrong, taking Alfred Homis along for the ride.  Thrown into a parallel universe where the laws of physics are just a little messed up, Alfred finds himself trapped inside the very machine he'd helped to build.  Add magic, hostile fantasy creatures, and two different pantheons of 'Gods' to the mix and things get even more complicated.
Oh, and an invasion between universes to boot. 
But that's just all in a days work though for Alfred, the AI Lord.
 




Authors Note:
Hi guys!  Long time no see.  And yes, I know that's all on me.  But I blame life for that.  Anyway, this is my new work, and I hope you guys enjoy it!  The chapters are a little shorter than I'd previously posted in my other stories, but I cannot say that I have the same amount of time or energy to write them like that anymore.  Sorry about that.
Still, some warnings:  There is cursing in this story.  I am not going to edit it out.  There will be sexual content later.  Blood, gore and cruel depictions are all planned.  If that isn't your thing, I'd suggest you turn back now.  There is also my dry, and often not-so-funny sense of humor.   And oh, it's all in first person gain.  Haha.  I just tend to write better that way.
If none of that bothers you, then enjoy the read!  Feel free to comment, point out mistakes, or make suggestions!  Reviews are nice too, but please lay off the criticism until the story gets good and going.  Thank you.

Author's Note: I'm busy here and I'm unable to post chapters for Winter Sovereign. But I can't let the season past without a chapter... So, while working and reading some novels, I got struck with an inspiration. You guys know of Yoraikun? He sometimes translates one-shots that are amusing, interesting and very light-hearted. My personal favorites are My Hero and Summer Homework filled with too much fantasy and the sequel to that. Man, those one-shots were pretty good. They made my day. So, I decided with my limited skill, to write a one-shot I just gained inspiration for. Enjoy. Just as usual, I don't need attention, I just like to write novels that are light-hearted and relaxing. I do like some criticism to improve my work though. That aside, I suggest Cultivation Chat Group and Monster Paradise to some people who are fond of new concepts. I'm a sucker for them haha...

***Current Schedule***  
I am currently releasing 1 3,000(Sometimes I end up writing waaaay more) word chapter halfs every week. If there is not some sort of notice as to why I have vanished, then I'm probably dead. Let's hope I don't die then, eh? *Ducks under flying knife*
I own this cover, put my own blood, sweat and an hour of my time into it. Ahahaha!
This story is inspired (I stress this word, as because most of the story is different) by Will Wight’s Cradle. I highly recommend you read it! (Please for gods sake, if you have something to say, please do it in a curteous fashion. I don’t need any more maniacs flying at me and trying to stab me with sporks, I am already insane enough to fill that role.*Winks*)
**What is This Story?**
Think cultivation mashed with western fantasy, put into a pot to boil and then drunk while it's pipping hot. All the while a mad man(me) cackles insanely over the pot, stirring. It draws from xianxia lightly, which means no exasperated angry young masters. No “genuis” or “prodigy” MC, one that is not OP, or anything of the like. If you don’t like cultivation novels, this might still be up your alley. MC focuses on “Life Shaping”, see poll 2 for more Info. 
Warning! If your are squeamish, that gore and traumatizing content tag is there for a reason. I shall dive into both bloody and disturbing scenes and the questionable ethics of manipulating life, and some of it won’t be pretty. With a dose of realism added in.
I do add my own evi- I mean despic- no, sorry, interesting twists aswell. >:)
 Also, I HATE info dumps! *Steps out of the way of a charging semi* Still not dead!

Ash is finally old enough to receive his first Pokémon from Professor Oak, the town's Pokémon expert-but on the morning Ash is supposed to claim it, he oversleeps! By the time he arrives at Professor Oak's, the three Pokémon he wanted have already been chosen by the other Trainers-in-training, including his rival, Gary! The only Pokémon remaining is a strong-willed Pikachu. Trainer and Pokémon don't get along right away. Not only does Pikachu refuse to enter its Poké Ball, it would rather climb a tree than battle a Pidgey that Ash encounters! Disagreements aside, they start to bond when they find themselves chased by an angry flock of Spearow. The Spearow wound Pikachu, but Ash risks his own safety to protect his Pokémon. To further their escape, Ash ""borrows"" a bike owned by a young girl named Misty. He soon wrecks the bike, however, and he and Pikachu are surrounded by the Spearow. When Ash fearlessly confronts the Spearow, Pikachu is inspired to summon its remaining energy to repel the Pokémon with a powerful electric shock. Finally out of harm's way, the wild experience makes Ash and Pikachu realize that they've begun what promises to be a blooming friendship.",5

15477,The Blue Mage of Power *Temporary Title*,"Dark....
All I could feel is the darkness surrounding me. 
It feels warm, like wrapped in a blanket, keeping me safe and content. 
It's an unusual feeling. Not being able to open your eyes or know where you are but there's no sense of being lost, being alone, only a strange comfort that you're gonna be okay.
It feels weird not knowing who you are, but you recall distant memories, memories that are important to you, the one that you should never forget, but its out reach, you can almost touch the tip of that forgotten memory but then it vanishes.
I don't know anymore. Seems like my sense of time is warp, like I can't tell how long I've been here. Has it been hours, days, weeks or month or even years.
I keep waiting. 
Waiting for that sense of panic, that strangling paranoia, the constricting of the heart.
But what I was expecting never happened.
Suddenly, I feel exhausted and the need of sleep overcome me.
*****
I'm still in the same situation, but I could feel myself getting bigger, stronger. taking shape into something significant.
I can feel my limb twisting and turning, growing into an arm, a leg, a body.
I guess I have grown a pair of ears, because I can hear sound, strange noises outside whatever place I'm in.
I guess I could somehow guess, I'm maybe a fetus growing inside of a woman or in a mad scientist laboratory, like one of those test-tube babies.
I shuddered at the thought.
Hmm.. maybe this is how you are born into the world, with a strong sense of awareness and maybe slightly advance intelligence?
And then you forget everything after you come out of the womb, and then you become more dumber, more primitive?
*Sigh* I'm not even making sense anymore.
Here we go, the feeling of tiredness hit me again. I don't know how many times I've slept since I've been here but its been more than I could count.

So much of the culture from the ""Firsts"" was lost that even the meaning behind the isolated continent's name is unknown which only serves to add to the enigma of how so much knowledge disappeared.  The multiple wars that followed created divisions, scarred the land and lead to a progressively more warring culture that persists to this day on the continent.

This is the story of Kallok Glaur Thanatos, a man who is no longer bound to the orders of others. He is not a good man, but nor is he pure evil. He’ll make the occasional joke, get to know people and have friends, but in the end, he has a name to live up to, and how he does love living up to it.

Hi guys, my name is Dragos and this is my first fiction. It’s an original, but there are concepts that have been taken from many different novels I’ve read so some bits might feel similar to other stories you’ve read.
This fiction is a LitRPG and the character will most likely end up being a bit OP but he’ll have to grow to get there. I’ll most likely ask for opinions at times and change concepts so please do be patient and do give feedback as it would be really helpful.
18+ for strong violence, gore, language, some sexuality, and nudity (will most likely not have lemons so if that’s what you are here for, then you’re out of luck)
Release schedule: Will try to get two chapters each week, but that will depend on the chapter length and also my university schedule.",58

15537,The Last Songstress,"When the seventh moon rises in the night sky, the creatures of darkness will rise from the abyss and bring forth with them chaos and destruction. They will flood the Ethereal Plane and will lay waste to all of its inhabitants, purging the world for the coming of the Demon God.
The era of the seven heroes have long since passed but they left behind clues about how to face this nightmare. With the birth of the Child of Prophecy and armed with the knowledge of what is to come, man along with the united races of the Ethereal plane prepare themselves for the final confrontation.
Aerie, a survivor of the Watcher clan from the Mist Forest becomes an adventure to gain power and avenge the catastrophe that befall her Clan. Along the way she will gather party members to aid in her quest and will learn the truth about the world and the secret behind the Last Songstress.",1
15538,Displaced,"Sucked into the void without warning, a handful of people from around the globe suddenly find themselves in the foreign world of Scyria, a place filled with people who can jump three times their height, conjure fire from thin air, and perform any number of other inhuman feats.  Scattered across the realm and armed with newfound powers far greater than those of the native Scyrians, they each struggle to find their path in this unfamiliar reality.  Their unforeseen arrival sends tremors throughout the world, toppling a centuries-long age of relative peace, prosperity, and progress as they each leave their mark on the world in their own ways.
But Scyria has its own share of intrigue, even without these unwelcome guests.  A major metropolis is wiped from existence out of nowhere, triggering a manhunt across the continent for those deemed responsible.  Two feuding nations decide to bring their hostilities to a new level.  Blades clash, nations fall, and plots years in the making begin to reveal themselves.
This is the story of some unwilling trespassers, taken from their lives against their will and thrown into situations they barely understand.  This is the story of some unfortunate Scyrians, their lives blown apart by the newcomers’ sudden and destabilizing existence.  This is the story of Scyria, a world with a lost past buried beneath millenia.  But as both the Earthlings and Scyrians are about to find out, sometimes the past doesn’t stay buried forever...

Updates very slowly with large chapters, so sometimes will lapse into Hiatus status, but I am always slowly chipping away at a new chapter.  My life has gotten complicated, but I haven't stopped writing when I could.  Even if it's been several months of silence, a new chapter is coming.
I marked the story as having Gore, Sexual Content, and Traumatising content because it does contain a bit of all three, though not what I believe is a significant amount.  Just wanted to be safe.  It does contain a whole lot of profanity, though.  That one is very much deserved.
I post one chapter ahead on Patreon here, you can get it for a dollar: https://www.patreon.com/IrateRapScallion

Kind of a ""what if"" scenario thing, however, it's also different as instead of focusing on a situation of what happened if a character made another choice, it focuses on what if a new variable was added.

15568,The First Archmage,"This story is only posted to here (RoyalRoad) by me, the author. Anywhere else it has been posted is not authorized by me. It is and will remain free to read.

Since it's had some attention now, I'm going to put in some quick heads-ups for everyone coming in:
1) This story was completed years ago and is my worst-written story. I have zero plans to come back and edit it because of how long ago it was completed and my desire to move on from it.
2) I did not put much care into the writing of this story. That said, Gavin is a kid with some issues early on and it takes awhile for him to start to mature. If you're not interested in waiting on that sort of thing, you're warned.
3) There is zero romance/sex for Gavin in it, but his main party companions are gay, so if that's a turnoff for you, you're warned.

Not everyone has access to the System - in fact, very, very few become Adventurers. No one knows how the System selects new Adventurers, or why. The System enables people to level up, to gain skills and stats far stronger and much faster than those without access to the System. While magic does exists, no one has ever had the option of a magic class.
Until now - Gavin, an orphan in a small village, is watching a group of Adventurers passing through speak with the village Elders when he suddenly gains access to the System, and one of the Classes he can take on initially, based on his stats and skillbase from before he gained access, is ""Wizard"".
In a world where Adventurers must swear fealty to their kings or be branded as traitors, can Gavin - a mere boy - keep his secret long enough to become a force none can abuse? Or will his secret be known, and his advanced magical abilities used for a cause he doesn't support?","1,879"

Hey there everyone! This story isn't meant to be anything professional grade, but rather will just be something I do on the side. I have always enjoyed stories like this, and I have some background in a writing based major, so I thought it might be fun.

Keep in mind that this will have some litrpg elements, but I'll try to keep the info dumps to a minimum. Regardless, this will be a relatively slow story, and if that's not your style then that's totally ok! Enjoy!

This is somewhat of a self-insert but I made sure not to make the MC to OP. Also, the creator of the cover is Vurguy I tried to contact him to ask for permission but couldn't due to technical issues please go support him on Deviant Art and I don't own the picture so if he wants me to take it down than I am completely okay with doing so. 
As I am an improving author, I am glad to receive any constructive criticism or critical review I just hope that everyone will give me a chance before they yell at me for something or at least tell me what made them angry so I know what the issue is and can figure out how to deal with it. 
For now, my schedule is 1-2 chapters a week and if I am busy with either work or school 1-3 chapters every 2 weeks. I expect a bunch of chapters at the beginning around 5 or so and for me to continue from there. I will try my best to keep some chapters in storage for any time where I can't write for whatever reason. I will continue to change this part of the synopsis if anything changes in my update schedule. - From a thoughtful Author 

Pocket Dungeon is a widespread interstellar game that has captivated the attention of many races and civilizations. Nowadays in the 2300s anyone not living under a rock would grow up with a dungeon and learn to manage it over time as they make mistakes along the way. But as all things go there is always an exception and this exception can be found in Nadezhda Ledopad who had an overprotective family that didn't let him interact with anything but those they deemed worthy and safe. This overprotectiveness caused them to forbid him from gaining a pocket dungeon as they knew with his intelligence and specialties in certain fields he would become a strong dungeon master, quickly. This was something his family was very much against as they knew that his competitiveness and duty to maintain the Ledopad family's reputation would push him to win in the competitions that he would inevitably get invited too.
This all changed when Nadezh graduated high school and moved to the Celestial Plane capital star as a Prodigal student in planetary conservation (major) and revival of species through DNA transferal (minor). His brother in all but blood Tet schemed to get him into Pocket Dungeons when they got there as no one would keep Nadezh from playing. Nadezh excited to join his peers in this famous game looked forward to doing so. But with this one decision, many futures changed and the Fates laughed as people of strong destinies meet together on this plane. 

Warning - This will probably contain LGBT+ relationships. You have been warned, I will not tolerate stupidity to the ninth degree in the comment section and I hope that people can be logical enough to GO AWAY if they don't like this kind of thing. If you don't feel comfortable with mature or explicit scenes I will put a warning in the chapters or parts with such and I just wanted all of you to know that this will be a long novel as with most novel I will write in the future so don't expect a deep romantic relationship anytime soon.",30

Hey~ What's up? My name is Viktor, yep, the one and only. 
What you're seeing right now is what I call my ""dark thoughts"", you're not going to see everything as I see it, no, you're going to see what I distort it to be.
Blood in the water. Some things trigger me, I'm not the strongest guy, but with my excellent charisma, I might get people to do the rough things for me. Adding to that my extraordinary perception, a fly wouldn't be able to come near me without me knowing.
I was not always this ""kind of guy"" but better for you to just find that out for yourself, yes?

This is my first story, please be thoroughly critical as I wish to improve as quick as I can, though I would appreciate just simple thumbs ups every now and then.
Disclaimer: any gore, brutal, and utterly criminal words written are not representative of the real writer's thoughts, but I will not intend to pull my punches, this is fiction, after all.

But after getting wrapped up in matters of National Security, she is ordered to undergo a dangerous procedure rumored to cause memory loss and dementia. After the excruciatingly painful experience, she awakens inside the Augmented Reality MMORPG game CONQUEST to face a terrifying threat unlike anything she has ever encountered before.

Now in a First-Person-Shooter (FPS) setting, Brittany comes head to head with many foes in battles of wits and survival with her limited ammunition. Little does she know however, that the more she levels up in the game, the more she carries out the sinister work of the Leviathan.

Playful at heart, Martyr cubs prowl and hunt like humanoid lions. When they reach adulthood, their features harden.

James is a normal type of human; short on cash, and desperately trying to build a life for himself. His parents died when he was a young teen, leaving only his little brother Michael behind. They made it through together, but James knew they would never have a comfortable life. So when the military approached him with a high paying contract, James couldn’t refuse. That was how he became the first person ever to enter a fully immersive virtual reality world.
Join James as he saves the life of a rambunctious Martyr cub, is adopted into their clan, and uses magical spells and abilities to help his new family grow from a small band of survivors on the run, into what they once were: ancient and powerful protectors of the Great Savanna.

And once upon a time, the demon king met a god.

A broken boy.
A boy who knew only to take.
A boy who brought the night.
But now he wonders: 
Why?
Why must he only take?
Why must he bring the night?
And why must the day die for the night to be born?

  I was raised as an only child. I am independently wealthy (read: won the lotto) and I live alone in a small house in the suburbs.
  Today I just got my brand new game console and game, W.O. this is the game of the decade by Animagus Industries.  It's just arrived the tech guys from Animagus are here to install it because it is a lot of sophisticated equipment.  The game console is actually a FIVR pod.  It has a month-long dive time RL with a 4:1 time compression ratio meaning every four hours in-game is an hour IRL.  As long as you don't eat any solid food when you enter it should be able to break down any waste you produce after you've entered.  It has a fully automated med-bed meaning it prevents muscle atrophy and kicks you out of the game if you're having any medical problems while also calling for an ambulance.
  As I started to boot up my pod I took a deep breath and started to get dressed into my skin suit so the pod could get better readings.  Then I hopped in the pod and closed my eyes and when they opened I saw a whole new world.

Follow young Jayce's misadventure through the hardships of survival within barren lands and others, fighting for one's dear life against impossible odds and finally...something else.
 

 
Beyond the end, there is new beginnings. If anything is left to start it out...
The world has long ended, for what reason nobody remembers. Society has taken several steps back, as people learned to live within the barren lands they were left with. Survival is an everyday struggle within the village cut off from the rest of the world.
Even for Jayce, a young boy of fourteen.
Everyday was the same for Jayce. Wake up then wash within the mildly clean water and then dress with whatever tatters remained together. He'd eat a somewhat satisfying meal of whatever rodent his traps caught during the night or what leftovers his employers didn't wolf down at dinner yesterday.
The rest of the day? Clean, do chores and...clean some more.
Jayce was a servant for the village's guard, an honor they told him. But he didn't believe all that, he knew he was just another poor runt nobody could feed yet nobody could watch die on the street either...or well...nobody wanted to clean up the next morning.
Water was limited per day by the masters, food even more so but more due to lack of. Yet the village of Oasis made due, no matter what. It was a rather large village, surviving mostly off the actual oasis it was built over. The village's iron buildings twisted and rose above the water, held up by large wooden platforms and pathways. Several hundred meters, so high up that falling would lead to instant death.
Even if you landed in the water, which you most probably would anyway. Unless you were...Ahem...thrown at an awkward angle.
Every day was the same...But one day, everything went as wrong as it possibly could go for poor little Jayce.",17

It was to find someone with a magnificent destiny and transplant the poison to this someone with a magnificent destiny, thereby going against fate, which is something the poison loves.

First off, I wanna talk a bit about the story itself. The Prologue is merely intended to set the tone, and tell you a bit about the setting. Im going to address a few of the tags beforehand, so people arent entirely unaware. The vast majority of what I have written so far is merely to test the waters, and gauge reactions. I have included a gender bender tag because it's going to involve the main character, but the story itself wont revolve around it.
A bit of warning to readers; First off, plans for later parts of the story are hazy at best. Finally, I have no plans on abandoning this story, as I dont think its really fair to the readers to up and abandon a story. Ill be sure to tell you guys whats up if that occurs (Which I hope does not, barring RL circumstances).

Magic/fantasy world with Magus' at the apex of power. 
Magus are created through the enlightenment of... something(?) and it allows them to channel mana through that enlightenment.  (ex: find enlightenment in fire = become fire mage)  Finding enlightenment is exceedingly rare, and almost never happens, but when someone is enlightened they can pass the power down to their decendants, with a generational deterioration.
This really only affects... skill/training/power-gaining proficiency?  I'll likely be putting in a power/progression system, but as of writing the prologue, i havent flushed it out (lol) I'll be putting some thought into it before i do anything though.

Before you lot bashes me up with my English etc., consider this:
1. This is my first novel. First conceptualized and written some 23 years ago. Only until last year that I did some improvisations and improvements to what I had kept in the dusty corner of my room all these while. This story sees the light of the day because I challenged myself, that's all.
2. English is the 6th language that I speak.And in RRL, I'm using British English mostly to write my story.
3. Easier said than done. Rather than subjecting me to subjective comments/reviews about the language, point it out and suggest an alternative. One or two would do just fine. It goes a long way.

-
You will see an overpowered main character with a cheat ability.  You will see ""comedy"". You will see a normal guy who gets teleported to another world. You will see classic wuxia elements like Qi cultivation and alchemy.  You will see grammar from a native speaker. You won't see a ruthless MC who kills everybody that offends him. You won't see harem. 
It's essentially everything I like about light novels, web novels, and wuxia all shoved into one story. 
If you’d like an unholy mix of overpowered main character, wuxia, fantasy, and LitRPG - give The Only Real Cultivator a try.
6/1/2020 edit: Some bloke plagerized this book and put it on amazon, titling it ""Ancient Cultivator."" tbh I'm kinda flattered that I'm worth plagerizing. Still, don't buy the book. The whole thing's available here for free.","2,317"

Regular chapters, once or twice per week. On the weekends usually.
I will finish this novel, be it takes 1 year or 2. It will get a proper ending. Afterall, the ending is paramount.
Also, the readers might feel rewarded if they look closely while reading. I try to be quite mindful and put in interesting details or things that would come into play later.
And, personally i think that reviews on this site might as well be pointless. Unless you know the reviewer and think that you share his views. Your thoughts on a particular thing (like a novel) can differ from others. So, do give it a try before arbitrarily deciding.
This is my try to perfect the 'master of all/everything' type of MC, inside a proper, realistic VR world, from a game design perspective and immersion and no convenient 'convert gold to irl currency' button.
It is going to be a game first of all. Not a fantasy world overloaden with status screens and skills you can't possibly keep track of. A game with all of the real world aspects to it. Not a cheap fantasy world with shoehorned in stats.",221

Let’s say you are in a city or a town commuting to work when several black-holes break into the sky. Something pours out of them that turns the air into a slightly grey color and it falls to the ground. The unsuspecting elderly and children underneath them just stop and begin to twitch before they begin attacking anyone next to them.
You see this happening in a daze, wondering what could possibly be happening, when something else drops down from one of those holes in the sky. It lands on the ground perfectly. You see that it kind of looks like dog, except that it has black and grey patterned skin with no fur. Its claws look more like paws with knives sticking out of them and its mouth cannot fully close as its teeth are too large. The eyes, with frog-like pupils, are already choosing their first target, and they finally land on you, who is inside a somewhat safe vehicle. However, you can’t drive out of the situation because of the already chaotic traffic rendering the safe haven useless.
The black-holes are open all over the sky with that grey colored air spreading everywhere and more variations of those creatures are dropping down from them. Some of them land on two legs and some appear able to fly.
You finally begin to react, but what should you do?

""I thought Fantasiaia was a VRMMO,"" Mark muttered as he made his way to his coffee machine. ""How can someone reincarnate into a game?""
Of course, what Mark didn't know was that logic and reason didn't matter. It was magic! Besides, everyone loves virtual reality stories and reincarnation novels. So why not have both?
Mark shook his head sadly, but prepared his coffee in silence. When he finished, he looked up at the sky—and saw only the dull white ceiling of his apartment. He felt utterly cheated that the last thing he would see in this world was the peeling paint on the wall.
""They are not paying me enough for this,"" Mark grumbled, then drank up his coffee.
And then he died.

Author's note: This story is based on a campaign run in a homebrew of Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition. While it contains no copyright materials, I wish to note this as the reason for using D&D is to create a more random story. The kind of story where characters can die at any minute. I'm hoping this method helps make writing each chapter more fun and exciting for both my audience and myself. Depending on the success of this story, I may do another in the future.

6/29/2018 FINAL UPDATE
I've decided to stop writing 'Echoes of the Mirror'. After hours of grueling over the writing, I've learned that I no longer have any interest in this story, and am not the proper author for this genre. That being said, I've decided to move on to a new project named 'E.O.T.M', containing many of the same characters, personalities, and themes that you've enjoyed in this one.
At a later date, I'll end up pulling 'Echoes of the Mirror' altogether, including in it as a Patreon perk (if my new project is successful).
Thank you all for your support, and I look forward to interacting with you in the near future!
Happy reading!

15929,Tales of the Witchers,"A short story anthology based on the Witcher Saga by Andrzej Sapkowski using the world that the CDProjektRed developers envisioned. Tales of the Witchers is a fan-fictional work using Sapkowski's world but with original characters and using locations often unseen in the books or games. All creative liberties taken are my own, and I acknowledge any discrepancies with the original works, though I have tried to be as faithful as possible with the information provided.
Tales of the Witchers follows three different witchers - a female witcher from the School of the Griffin, a duo of witchers from the School of the Cat, and an ancient witcher from the School of the Bear.
Tales of the Griffin follow a young female witcher, the only known one in the world. She is not properly trained before setting off into the large world, and often hides her inexperience behind what she thinks of as the witcher's code. Tales of the Griffin discovers not only what it means to be a witcher, but rediscovers what it means to be human.
Tales of the Cat follow two witchers: one honorable and just, and the other unscrupulous, willing to take on assassinations or petty theft in order to earn capital. They are offered ""dirty"" jobs, and debate over the ideals of witchering. Is there honor in being a witcher? Is the job of the witcher to fight Evil and Chaos? Tales of the Cat explores these concepts amidst bank heists with dopplers, dinner parties with vampires, and more.
Tales of the Bear follows an ancient witcher who has survived half a dozen Skelligan monarchs. It has been said that no witcher has ever died in his own bed: will he be the first? He reflects over his long life, the jobs that he has taken from monarchs, jarls, and humble fishermen of different eras, and imparts his wisdom to the next generation of witchers. Tales of the Bear examines how traditions change over the course of many lifetimes, and ultimately shows the satisfaction that a witcher can have from a life well lived.

15930,Lamentations for the Bygone,"""In the spiral arms of the Milky Way, among stellar dust and cosmic clouds, there is a planetary system which orbits the star Sol. The system contains nine known planets, countless dwarfs, two asteroid belts, and a single yellow sun. Of those nine major planets, five are colonized, and the other four are being terraformed for our use. The galaxy felt bigger in those days.""
Lamentations for the Bygone is an original work about the frontier of space, imagining what it will be like when our known universe is ""taken up"" and the romance of space is gone. Where will the heart of adventurers take them when there's nothing left but emptiness conquered by highways and light pollution? One day, as we have lamented the bygone frontiers of continents fully charted and oceans entirely explored, we will lament the bygone frontier of the Milky Way.

The hero that was summoned, a lone man, has brought hope and salvation to everyone. Eventually, the hero defeated the Demon Lords but because of what he witnessed about this world, he himself becomes dismayed and chose isolation.

I was a webnovel junkie for a long time, but I found it hard to find novels with solid characters, decent plot, philosophical underpinnings and a fully painted world to keep me going. I've taken from every genre I've liked to make a story that satisfies my own cravings for a good story. If you like the story or have suggestions please leave a comment or review. I hope this novel is fun, provocative but above all fun. Enjoy.
Yours truly,
James Paul Addington
PS I will release at least two chapters a week, or one really long chapter.
Concerning the tags:
The story is primarily Fantasy with Wuxia influence in some elements. Romance won't happen for the first two arcs or so (roughly 40 chapters), I want to build the world before I do that. Tragedy is because of an event that occurs in the book, not the tone of the book. The book is more lighthearted. Slice of Life doesn't occur till the third arc (the romance happens during that arc as well). Magic will also show up more in later arcs, but appears throughout. Reincarnation it's not a reincarnation like in the traditional sense, but it has a similar concept.",65

To add to this, he has suffered severe damage to his soul and as if that wasn't bad enough he's lost, far away from any world he knows and maybe even his universe.

16075,A Broken World [Dropped Pending Rewrite],"This work has been dropped- because I am rewriting it.  Look forward to the new and improved ""A Broken World,"" now available HERE on Royal Road!
 
Three thousand years ago, Demonic creatures invaded the world.  Though their power seemed irresitable, a band of heroes managed to steal the knowledge of summoning rituals and worlds from them and created, ""The Millenial Summoning.""  A powerful magic that would bring forth a being from another world with the power to change the world forever.
The first being summoned became known as ""The Speaker,"" and he brought the power of the Gods with him.  Teaching prayers and invocations that blessed humanities legions and began to push back the demons, founding of the ""The Church of the Spoken Word"" rose to power and a stalemate was reached.
Two thousand years ago, that stalemate was broken by the second casting of ""The Millenial Summoning,"" and the arrival of ""The First Sorceress,"" who taught humanity the basics of magic and enchanting.  With the power of the Sorceress, the mages, and the priests the tide turned and the Demonic hordes began to be shoved back, signaling hopes of a golden age for mankind.
One thousand years ago, the hopes of final victory and a new dawn for mankind were dashed by traitors who slew the participants of the ritual and took their places, using the ritual to bring forth a godlike being from the demons home world, ""The Demon King,"" for no human knew his name, erased millenia of growth reducing humanity to barely a fragment of its former glory.
Now the ritual is being cast again, and a new being is being summoned...

The balance of life was interrupted due to the souls not having their lifelines not yet used up. The excess energy is starting to spread miasma which is changing the planet to slowly dying.

Seeing this, the overseer of death and life, Anubis decided that it is time to stop it. Or at least, do so temporarily
Thus, he focuses all the miasma into one truck, drastically changing the matter within and somehow changing the protons and energizing it. Creating a what would be called as a life. Something that is not expected.
However, none of those matters. After all, the story will be focusing on ""Track Carrier"", A Boy borne into a fantasy world where magic, fantasy, and an exciting life awaits!",4
16079,Zeroth Knight,"Isekai, fantasy, with the core themes of Identity and Fate.       Story contains a, mostly, lesbian cast.

     Just when she was about to confess to the man of her dreams, Eve is taken by a light to another world. Swallowing her up, against her will, eroding her, it demands a life so contrary to her previous one. In a new world with the title of “Zeroth” forced upon her, she must rely on her newfound “friends” to stay sane and navigate her responsibilities.
     But bit by bit, the world loses sight of the girl inside; seeing only “Zero,” the person she did not desire to be, but the hero that the world needed.
     Will Eve let the title she bears consume her, or will she become the hero in both body and mind? This is the tale of her struggles, and a star-crossed love destined by Fate to never converge. This is the tale of Zero.

      This story is a slow-burn, meant to be a few hundred pages or more in length, so the plot isn't the fastest to move. It also has lesbian-themed relationships for the majority of its cast. This story partially falls under, ""harem"" with the main character being female and gaining the affection of other females, against (at first) the main character's (Eve) will.
      This first arc will be more focused on the mentality and emotions of the cast with battles spaced intermittently. The second arc will involve a lot more fighting.
 Arc two will be out in a reasonable timeframe.

Once, a great man said that God made everyone in His image, but that does not mean that we are all the same. Everyone is the same at birth, but then you are wondering why there are differences in jobs and status partners? 
These differences are created in the scriptures, which have passed into society, but the situation is more complicated than that. People are capable of thinking and those who want to rise in social status are pushed from their ladders and knocked down to the very confines of hell itself that was created by these same people who are defeated. 
In other words, the word equality is full of false lies and ideals. I was trying to find an answer to this problem, but will be forever facing dilemmas and dead ends.We live in a world where possibilities are reduced to little more than crumbs and we just have to live with it. 
Of course we have exceptions, otherwise we would not evolve as a species, so we are always learning from the mistakes of those who passed before us.",0
16135,The Nightwatch Chronicles,"Long ago, all of the races and creatures of the worlds lived together in unity. Elves, Giants, Humans, Dragons, Sprites and so on all cooperated and helped one another build up their societies under their respective Gods which had brought them into existence. Forever back, this existence stretched, until one day, the race known as Human began to hide away from the others, having discovered the idea of Technology.
This Technology, when fed with thought and insatiable resources, made their lives easier and easier. Only, had they dedicated themselves to Magic, their lives too would have been made easier. But this difference in their ways made them feel more powerful and important. So they continued to develop their Technology until the demand was so great that they took from others and claimed land that was the home and nourishment of other races.
They dammed up the rivers and cut the forests and mined out the hills and mountains until eventually, it seemed that the Humans would consume all of the land and there would be nothing else but Humans left. Before a conflict could erupt, as it would have and left untold deaths on either side, the Gods intervened.
They split the world in 9 smaller worlds, each of them to be given to a particular group of races. Midgard, however, was given only to the Humans for it was a prison. They could stay there and do whatever they pleased, be it Technology or Magic, only they would slowly forget all they knew of the World Whole and the creatures and races they had once called friend.
And so it passed the the Humans were cast out and bound in Midgard as a dangerous animal is into a cage. As predicted, they forgot the truth and labeled their memories as fairy tales and myths. Sad but relieved, the other races replenished and undid the damage caused by the Human arrogance and greed, their existence all but forgotten by the very realms.
In this way, another long time of peace fell over the realms - other than Midgard, where Humans endlessly found new means and reasons to kill and hound each other and the very land itself. It seemed that they would burn out and Midgard would join Niflheim as a world of emptiness and death. Only, before the races could see that come about, they had a new problem to contend with.",0

16201,D Days,"Dragons were the apex predators of the magical world, feared for their strength and intelligence. They stood at the pinnacle of creation, until mankind fueled by fear and envy banded together and struck them down as the greatest threat to the continued existence of their kingdoms. Peace reigned for many years across the continent, until an accident in the Magocracy of Ken turned one of the most powerful mage lords into a power mad lich. Raising an undead army and creating a cult that worshipped him like a god, he cut a bloody swath across the continent in a bid to create his own domain.
A great alliance consisting of the Kingdom of Light, the Magocracy of Ken, the Forest Kingdom of the Elves, the Mountain Kingdom of the Dwarves, and the Wild Tribes of the West rose up and the high lich was defeated, his armies destroyed, and his cult scattered. Still recovering, the world is a constant state of petty power struggles and back biting between nations. Border disputes are common and the constant fighting has taken a toll on the populations of all the nations.
Of course, none of this has much bearing on the everyday life of a an ordinary young orphan in the care of a Temple run home. Or does it?

Dearest fans, I apologize for yet another extended absence. I have been dealing with so much in my everyday life that writing has taken a back seat. I am returning to continue the stories that I have already started but during my time away have been doing some deep soul searching of my own. I have always been told to write things that I know and are passionate about. However, the way my mind works, does not think that this sort of story would be appropriate, nor appreciated. It may be unliked. Then, I thought of the authors I have loved so much, such as Edgar Allen Poe. He was not well known or liked at the time of his writings. So, it is now with a deep breath that I begin a story of a girl whose life will reflect my own in various ways. 
Mental Illness can and always had stigmas. With this story, I am hoping that there may be some more empathy, compassion, and understanding of what these people go through. How some may view the world. Even though it is ridiculous to others. It is hard to explain these things but through the eyes of the main character, I am hoping that these people that suffer daily, are no longer pinned as ""just people seeking attention.""",0

16245,{The Dragon Within} (Completed),"Meeting his fate at the hands of seven great heroes, the wicked drake now stands in Death's hall. Met with the Grim Reaper itself.
Defeated and its pride broken, the drake doesn’t beg or grovel, it simply awaits judgement. It waits for the God of the afterlife to send it on its way, to either the heights of bliss and peace or where it knew it would be sent. The depths of agony and torture, the halls of Tartarus, the father of monsters.
Grim looked up from its oaken desk and down at the creature that would have otherwise, if grown wiser and older,  matched the reaper itself in power. Its faceless guise, hidden by a black hood and whirling shadows, it briefly stared at the drake.
“You are unfit for the sky yet also too fit for the abyss,” Grim spoke, its voice a cracking whisper.
“Your time came too soon, the actions you have taken will lead your world to ruin…Be reborn, pitiful serpent. Yet remember what you have done, see what your actions have made that realm into. Let me show you, how your greed and gluttony have warped such a wonderful place and time.”
Grim raised its black-feathered pen towards the beast “Be reborn, as the weak pitiful creature you should have been born as. Take this both as a punishment and…a learning experience. For failure, can be the best teacher.”
The drake took a step back, hoping to escape this cruel fate. Yet none escaped Death, less so its embodiment. Screaming shadows engulfed his form, ripping away at his body and shape. Fangs of darkness sinking deep into his draconic flesh, warping it, changing him into something else…
Opening his eyes, the wicked drake felt none of its power, none of its magic and none of its might. As it stood at the edge of a cliff, looking down upon a ruined valley of rot and miasma. It glanced down at itself, seeing none of its sturdy scales or sharp claws.
The drake had been reborn...
As a Human.

16252,The Voice of the World,"Jason Elric used to be an ordinary college student living in the heart of San Francisco. He had a part time job, he played online games with friends he got along moderately well with, and he earned reasonably good grades. The worst he really had to worry about in life was turning in his coursework on time and not being late to class.
Now, though? Now fighting for his life and running from a horde of giant frogs that want to make him their next meal is just another Tuesday.
Thanks to a summoning ritual gone terribly right, Jason has found himself trapped in a world eerily similar to the role playing games games he used to play for fun. Unfortunately for the now ex-college student, everything happening around him is terrifyingly real and if he wants to survive, he’ll have to figure out how to exploit the system for his benefit before it’s too late.

The Voice of the World is the first part of what is planned to be a multi-book, Isekai LitRPG story with crafting elements, set in the fantasy world known as Verdania. This is my first time posting online for public consumption, so bear with me as I work to find a style that people like.
While I may occasionally write scenes that may deal with heavy concepts, expect this story to be primarily light hearted high fantasy. There will be a lot of common fantasy tropes involved, as this story got its start as a simple practice exercise, rather than any plan to actually post it. However, it’s grown on me, so I felt it’s worth sharing after all.
Thus, if you’re looking for more serious/original/unusual stories, you might want to look elsewhere. For the rest of you, feel free to leave suggestions, as well as to point out grammar and spelling mistakes; I’ll do my best to make edits to correct them. I do my own editing currently, and it’s easy to miss things when you know what’s supposed to be there, so such call outs are highly encouraged.
Content TLDR: No harems, probably no romance (unless it makes sense for the story later on) (it did, eventually), definitely no sex (keeping this PG-13 or close to it), limited profanity. Does/Will contain mixes of magic and technology (think Warhammer, Final Fantasy); copious amounts of blue tables; race, gender, and sexual equality concepts; crafting sequences; and (slightly, but not overbearingly) strong protagonists. If you don’t like these things, go elsewhere instead of downvoting people for content instead of writing quality.

A synopsis serves to attract attention without lying. This is useful because it gives a first impression of the novel, and immerse even before plunging into the story. Unfortunately, it does not count as one of my specialties.This fanfic is really peculiar and I think that few people will be able to appreciate it. So instead of trying to make you salivate, then have you disappointed, it would be better for you to make your own opinion, that is if you have time on your hands. 
If you do not like one piece or shounen animes, then you'd better turn back, as it would be a worthless read for you. 
If you've made it this far and have time to spare for yet one worthless attempt at making an original one-piece fanfic, then have a good read.

16298,This project has no purpose,"Summary:
This is the story about the life of a ""human"" amidst a world that only appears to be earth at first glance. Long ago the face of this world resembled the typical tales of yore; of knights and fairies, swords and magic, however such an era has come and gone. Even the world of fantasy has progressed steadily into the modern epoch filled with the wonders of science and technology!
In the ancient times a certain crisis had occured that lead to the quick decline of various magical species. Due to their low population and general incompatibility with the other races they could not crossbreed to save their numbers. Left with no other choice the major races of the world gathered together in an attempt to change the fate of this dying world. Their only hope was a special 'world-tier' magic known as 'the dusk of harmony'.
The result of this magic would dissolve every race into their purest essences known as 'aspect' and instill them within the human population. The humans were the best choice as their numbers were numerous and form was similar to most races. As such, the various races of this world managed to save themselves in essence and soul only, though perhaps there was no other choice.
With the various humans now carrying the weight and aspects of those who came before, life has continued onto the modern age. Yet, even amongst these hybrids 'Pures' emerge from time to time, beings who have inherited not only aspects of the ancient races, but their forms too. These Pures are often times exceptionally talented and seen as near deities.
This is the story of a perculiar boy who is born with the soul of a stranger from the world known as 'Earth'. With the memories and soul of a human, he too is a rare Pure; a pure human.

There was never really a chance that my Mega-Corp employer wouldn't catch me. I was convicted before they even kicked in our door, but my mom was cured. That made it all worth it. 
Now, I'm not Zachary, ""Zee"", Jones anymore, I'm Inmate 81348. My only chance at getting out of jail again is to sign up for the ""Inmate Gamer Release Program"". OzCo, the Mega-Corp that runs the entire Justice system now, will get to use my brain to mine crypto-currency, Crypts, for my restitution and profits. While they do that, I'll be playing the Game, a fully immersive virtual reality world, jacked into my brain. If I play well, I'll be out in 5-8 years, instead of the 20 I'd have in store by serving ""hard time"" IRL. 
There are many worlds within the Game, almost every bit of intellectual property ever created has been licensed to have representation in the Game. Statistically, I'll probably end up on Gygax because it's the most popular and has the most constant need for new players. It's a Medieval Sword & Sorcery world with Elves and Orcs, Wizards, and Knights. Wish I knew how to use a sword.

Have you ever thought about what you wanted to do if you were to be reborn? Become rich and powerful? Obtain a huge harem or forever live with your loved one?
Some people dream of becoming a god, some dream of simply disappearing, some dream of an eternal dream.
I too dreamed. I dreamed of a better life, one where my true nature could be unleashed without the shackles society brings me.
And now that my life finally ends, I dream once more. A dream of a world I am very familiar with, and yet know nothing about. As my consciousness fades, this dream becomes more and more vivid.

The Waffle House is a truly unique American phenomenon.
And that humble diner establishment is all that stands against the invariant toasters.

Yes. The tank. Specifically, the good ol’ M1 Abrams Main Battle Tank. 70 tons of concentrated American-made death. One 120mm smoothbore gun. A 50 caliber heavy machine gun complimented by a pair of M240 LMGs. Hell, it can even shoot missiles or grenades if you want it to!

16421,Where's My Unique Skill?! [Discontinued],"A world of magic and wonders, a world far different than ours. Such is a world that Davin, 'ProDavin888', or what other nicknames he had given himself throughout the ages had dreamed of. Secluded and hidden within his junkyard of a room, he could only hope as the young NEET fantasized and dreamed of this fantasy world of his. He himself wondered if perhaps, perhaps, he could one day get sucked into a world far different than earth and live there, fighting the evil and save the world!
And when such a chance showed itself after he had just gotten over his bad defeat in a recent FPS match, he couldn't wait and jumped straight in, leaving behind his room in silence, with no one there to clean up the mess he left behind. Waking up, he saw the leaves above, and instantly knew where he was.
This was a fantasy world!
But he immediately discovered two problems, two major problems. First, his stats were absolute sh*t. His pitiful show of stats only had a fill of 2's and 3's. And second, where were his unique skills?! Or just any skills in fact?!
Look, even in the light novels where the main protagonists get left beind by his/her team, they still had some kind of skill to aid them, but what the f*ck is this?! His skills list was empty! EMPTY!!! Oh, and third...Why the hell is he a girl?!
And so, started the story of Diana, previously Davin, as she travelled and survived in this new fantasy lands, only to be wrapped up in becoming a slime queen, getting targetted by goblin tribes, swallowing her own tears as she contemplated her life choices, and ultimately try and become the legend she imagined herself as. And also avoiding death at all costs.
But still, [Where's My Unique Skill?!]

Author’s notes:
A warning to all who try to read this I am terrible at writing and actively avoided it due to my dyslexia. I chose to try and change this by making my day dreams into a story. This is in hopes that I can find as much joy in writing adventures as I do in reading them. If anyone would like to make corrections or offer a better way to phrase, please feel free I know I have a lot of short comings in this field.
I hope to have many polls, so readers can have some involvement. I’m do not have a set idea for the romance in the story it may range anywhere from one partner to many. I like happy things, so violence and depressing things will be kept to a minimum though there will be some bad guys getting there due every now and then.",68

16469,The Cyclical Nature of Time,"A girl’s life ends unexpectedly early, or so it would seem. Instead of eternal nothingness, she wakes up in an empty valley with no clue how she got there. Taking her predicament in stride, she sets out to do something about it. Unfortunately for her, the first couple of people she meets aren’t much help. They claim they haven’t heard of electricity and dress as if they were on a break from their job at a Viking-themed amusement park.
MC is a somewhat normal girl. She's pragmatic and not very angsty. The story is tagged with anti-hero, but to be clear, she is not a villain. She does good if she can, she just isn't morally motivated to do so.
The story starts out smelling of fantasy but will eventually shift towards sci-fi. It contains some supernatural elements and has a strong lead, but it is not your usual power trip. Expect a story that takes its time, but not to the point where entire chapters are spent on mindless chit-chat. I’m not into that.
This is my first serious attempt at writing and I've learnt a lot writing this. Unfortunately, that shows. Chapter 1-10 is slow and rather pointless. Things get better, but it is not until chapter 25 or so that I began understanding how to structure chapters and to make them support the larger story.

16470,Two Skies and an Ocean,"A higly advanced civilization, driven by the greed of their monarchs, has destroyed the world they live in. They had already done it in the past, but, although scientists had managed to give the planet all it needed to flourish once more, the rich just wanted to be richer, and destroyed all their efforts. And so, all that was left was to run down to the Underground, once scavaged for resources by many, and almost completely unmapped. That left open the possibility to discover new and as of then unknown caverns between systems of tunnels built more than two centuries before this crisis. Almost the whole scientific community thought that it would be the only solution.
A group of trained men and women, part of the so called PROJECT, after promising to each remaining city on the surface an equal part of ""land"" to rebuild upon, started scouting this Underground, to make sure everything was safe, not knowing what they would uncover once down there.

I didn't feel ""ready"", so I started working on a simpler first fiction to start my journey! If someone ever sees this... you could convince me to pick this up again 
Stand strong!",1
16471,AWE: Adventures of a Reincarnated Noble Android Girl (Rebooted),"Hmmmmmmmmmm... it's dark and it's really wet. Am I inside something? A stomach? So I'm already dead? That was quick...
Wait, who am I!? Ah! That's right! My name is Derek! Derek... sumtin sumtin. I am a male at 17 years old, a Senior High student. I was enrolled in Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics and a...uhhhhhhhhhhh...
I think, I was studying to be an engineer. I remember drawing up blueprints and enganging in calculus. It must have been a nightmare... I have 2 younger siblings annnnnnd... 2 parents? I guess? 
 
... ... ... ...
... ... ...

...I'm very confused. Why can't I remember them? What was the name of the school I went to? I remember my chosen school track, my age, my art skills, and a black, retangular ""something"". But that's it. I can't even recall my name perfectly.

Huh?
Is that a light? 
Oh shit! I'm panicking! I'm panicking here! I'm not going! I'll never go into the light! Kiss my ass, guy calling out to me from within the light! I know I'm just imagining you, but still, KISS ASS!
I start to move away from the light. And that was when I noticed it.
I can't move.
I really can't move.
I'm desperately trying to get away, but the most I can do is just wiggle! And even worse! The slimy walls are contracting, squeezing me out, closer and closer into the light.
So, that's how you want to play it huh? Well, I ain't passing on, quietly. Get ready to be so annoyed you'd wish you didn't call out for me! Guy in the light!
I screamed from the top of my lungs. VERY ANNOYING SCREAM GOOOOOO!!!
""UuuuuwaaaaaaaAaaaaaaaaahhhh!!! Hic. Hic. UwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAaaaaaa!!!""
A high pitched, crying voice reached my ears once I was wrapped within the light.
""Milady, it's a girl!""

16475,Imppossible,"On a world fast falling into the Abyss while comfortably basking the warm glow of the Inferno, the Gods have gone mad, doing little to stop it. Real heroes don’t exist. Evil is mainly greed and fear or a combination of the two. Altruism is the vainglorious delusion of legacy. Right and Good are things best left to other people. Kings kill as many of their own subjects as their enemies do. Lords are as despotic as they can be without outright revolt and everyone in between jostles for space enough to breath, crushing their neighbours in the process. Some people see this as a freedom of a sort. Others see opportunity. Maybe they’re just more realistic about what life is though. Pragmatism has its benefits after all and a little reality and a lot of guile will keep you alive much longer than petty things like hope, idealism and dreams. Though sometimes it takes an outcast to do the right thing. Sometimes it takes the dead to save the living. Sometimes only madness can lead to truth and sometimes it takes a demon to defeat the forces of hell. Nothing is impossible.",3
16476,The Storm King,"Leon and his father, Artorias, are the last remaining scions of a once powerful and illustrious family of lightning mages.  After barely surviving an attack that destroyed their home fifteen years ago, they now live in the dangerous Northern Vales, a desolate wilderness far away from civilization.  But those who want them dead are strong, patient, and relentless, and it is only a matter of time before they find the two they seek...

16479,Order,"Power. Hunger. Death. The weight of lives upon shoulders. These aspects are only a few the world has to offer, yet each individually are more then enough to sway or blind a steady mind. How long can a life stay pure before transitioning into something else? Into something greedy, or selfish, weak or powerful. One who has lived more then a few full lives also contemplates such questions, long after the scent of blood had left his fingers. But when a interesting letter somehow finds it's way to Tzu's hidden home, a new hunger for these answers are rejuvenated. And with it, come his first steps back into the world.

Sixty two years had passed since a near cataclysmic event had taken place, and countless tales from those times and times before have been written into history. History, in of itself, is an excellent teacher to those from many backgrounds, but at the same time, it can teach those with malevolent intent to learn from the mistakes made by collegues and similar historical figures.
History can inspire to do good whilist preventing evil, yet at the same time, can inspire evil to become smarter, and more skillful in its ways.
An adventurer, accompanied by a protective guardian, had set out on a journey to explore the world of Aequiria, inspired by the thousands of tales formed previously, to forge a tale of their own through iron and strife.
. . .
A force known as the Aegi-Machina, souls bound to mechanical suits of armor powered by magic was formed by a figure known only as the ""Golden General"" during the times of strife sixty years ago. Their mission is to prevent those with power from becoming too powerful and causing another cataclysmic event, and to protect the weak from tyrannical entities. A report has shown that a powerful source of energy was found to the eastern regions of Eyr, and to fufil their mission; they must contain it.

He was a grand structure of ten thousand floors which even heroes had failed to defeat.
However, an Evil God had come from another world, calling himself the Demon King, and a party of heroes were sent to do battle with it. Through their victory, they obtained enough strength to breeze through Archimedes' dungeon like it was nothing. Forseeing the end of his life, and realizing how pointless his pursuit of power had been, Archimedes destroyed himself, taking the heroes down with him. 
Still, Archimedes felt despair that he had lived a worthless life as something as pitiful and futile as a dungeon. Sensing his regret and potential, the voice of the world presented Archimedes with the chance to start anew and live a more meaningful life. Thrilled and hopeful for the first time in eons, Archimedes accepted the offer, only to be reborn again as a dungeon core with not a single room or monster to his name.
Just what was the meaning of this?!
Archimedes couldn't figure out what the voice of the world was thinking. Somehow, he would have to draw a sage into his dungeon to figure it out for him.

16682,Yora Chronicles,"NOTE- Based on an internal discussion, please be advised the earlier chapters of this novel [Arc 0 and Arc I] is going through a major revision and rewrite to gap the 8 years experience since the first draft of this novel.  

[Arc 0 - The Prologue] 
Airen and Yuelei Casteya - Two twins separated in act of revenge not of their own doing. One is sent to the frozen north, where she is adopted by a frost phoenix and taught to survive in the harshest of conditions, eventually meeting with the forces that govern nature itself. The other is sent to the southern deserts and is saved by a band of slaves-turned-raiders who take him in as one of their own, where he eventually came into contact with a being that calls herself the History Eater.
The two sought power and the forces of the world would soon listen, but not without their own aspirations.
And perhaps if the two were to meet again, they would be so warped by their own hands and would not even recognize the other.

[Arc 1 - Disciple of the History Eater & Knighthood]

Under the guidance of Fieluri, the whimsical being from the Archive, Airen moves south to the Red Slate Republic to attend Stonewall Military Academy. There, he finds himself wrapped up in the History Eater's ploys, and at the same time, learns of the somber side of society in the slave-driven republic. Eventually, under Fieluri's instruction, he descends into the depths of dungeons where he eventually reunites with an old acquaintance.
Yuelei, who has grown used to living in the snowy mountains, moves north to the Holy Land of Ecclisa to attend the Royal Knight Academy. After Lin leaves, she slowly adapts to living with humans again, but not without ceaseless caution. The thinly-veiled peace is eventually broken, for the monsters that haunted the nights in the Whitefrost Mountains are returning once more. In response, the Holy Land of Ecclisa slowly prepare for war, but Yuelei is not just a mere bystander.
All paths eventually leads to conflict. When it arrives, one can choose to deter it away, or to revel in it.

16683,Time frame,"A knife-wielding psychopath entering his room was the last thing Jordan Winters saw before his full-dive vr helmet booted up. His body now lies defenseless in the real world but there is a silver lining. The vr helmet has a “synapse boost” option that can make his brain process information faster for a limited time, which creates a time dilation effect. One second out there becomes a week inside.
Within this limited time frame, Jordan must enter his newly purchased game ""Mesozoic Wars"", a prehistoric themed vrmmorpg, find a way around the restrictive speech mechanics to communicate with other players and come up with strategy to deal with the intruder when he inevitably has to log out.
It doesn't help that the game is very hard due to realistic survival conditions and that time dilation becomes less effective during respawns...

NOT MEDIVEL because god knows we don't need ANOTHER one of those.

What I hate about novels, and what you'll hopefully not find in this novel:
- Lack of consistency
- Lack of an end goal, and instead getting an endless loop of challenge and powerup cycle, with the only goal of 'getting stronger, because'
- Lack of logic in world building. When you think about it, Adventurers are glorified hunters and mercenaries, and that an organized army is more profitable and manageable then random 'adventurers' running around your kingdom. I want to kill myself every time I hear that fucking word.
- 2 dimensional characters, or dumbing down everyone else but the main character to make her look smart.
- Illogical actions, over complex actions or just random actions. Actions should have a purpose and a reason.
- Stupid pretentious names like the ""9 Purpule Ancient Emporer Heaven Piercing ThunderSrike Technique"" ...That's just a sword swing...

Schedule is whenever I feel like it, because else it would become a chore, and we would both benefit if I enjoy writing.

I don’t try and pretend that what I’m doing is original. There are many stories like it, yet I believe mine has something no others do. That something is my messed-up imagination.
I’m writing in Word so there shouldn’t be any major mistakes with spelling or grammar, but if the sentences themselves don’t make sense, that would be because English is not my first language.

16700,Hero of two worlds,"This my first time actually writing a fan fiction and as English is not my native language please bare with me. This fanfiction is actually a little guilty pleasure of mine, and as I don’t really like angsty stories that just have the main character behaving like a child with the world out to get them there will be a few clichés and an overpowered main character. As I said I’m new to this whole writing thing so cut me some slack and constructive criticism is welcome. There won’t be much character interaction in this first chapter because I want to get some character building for Harry going before getting to the meat of things I intend to try finishing this fanfiction I don’t want to finish it halfway so please bear with m,e it will be slow build up at first and I suck at battle scenes I’ll try but this will mostly be him kicking ass. thank you.Then let’s get ready for the disclaimers;I do not own Harry Potter or the franchise as I am not J.K. Rowling
At age 7 Harry was a mature child he grew up being generally despised by his relatives and being treated like an indentured servant he was never physically abused but he was forced to do more chores for Less food. As usual on his birthdays hear the woman's voice reciting strange words that he couldn't understand fully. On that same day he awakens a strange ability anything he writes becomes reality.

Four years later he returns a fully accomplished hero and mage.",5
16701,The Chronicles of Artharian Dagworth,"Back in 2020 there were many theories on how the world would end. From the many religions apocalypses, nuclear wars that would leave the planet inhabitable, global warming doing the same, biological weapons getting out of control,  viruses mutating into unstoppable diseases to the dead raising to prey on humanity, either due to a virus or just because hell filled up. 
Also, aliens, from the war mongering kind to the ones so advanced they didn’t see us as more than worms. And of course there was the fail proof theory that the world would end when the sun died. In a bunch of billion years give or take. Althougth some new scientist were discussing if the end would be on the take side, since when the sun started dying things would go haywire on the entire solar system and we would collide with mercury or maybe mars way before the expanding sun engulfed earth. But I digress… 
Now, those were the mainstream theories that the everyday Joe, who didn’t know the big secret, worried about.
So, if you were to ask me which theory was correct I can tell you that I haven’t seen any little green man, at least not from another planet, and so far the sun is still shining, although it’s been only 9 years since everything went to hell, not the few billions (give or take) the scientist predicted, so that one isn’t ruled out yet. These two aside, I'd say all of them. 
 
Hey everyone, this is my first attempt at writing. I have been planning to do it for a really long time, and while this is not the one epic fantasy idea I ever wanted to write, I think it's a good one. The plan is to write an end of the world urban-fantasy series. Think a world like Dresden Files, Alex Verus, Iron druid, where magic is real but exist hidden from society meets the apocalypse. It will be written in first person in the Dresden Files style, no plans for other POV for now. As you probally alredy guessed from my style, english is not my first langague, so while google corrector helps, expect grammar errors, and I'd be gratefull for anyone to point them. 
I plan to write 2 to 3 chapters a week, 2000-4000 words each. Might change as I get more experience and depends on my free time.

The United States and the Russian Federation had their nuclear missiles primed for launch. Fears of espionage surfaced, a cold war state reemerging in the world. Riots broke out in every country. The world came as close as it had ever been to total annihilation.
But somehow, the world restabilized. Over the years, with the two alien vessels remaining dormant, it slowly became clear there was no immediate threat. The world became more united than ever, with almost every nation working together to figure out what the purpose of the alien vessels was.
Five years after their arrival, Elysia discovered something amazing. She somehow knew how to understand the aliens; she could figure out what it was they wanted.

16721,I am but Divine,"Being a god is a dream. A very big, ambitious dream that probably no one has ever achieved. In the world of Taerrea, there were a set amount of gods that ruled over the world; the god of war, the god of the skies, the god the earth, etc. and that the general rule of thumb was that the numbers of the gods could not be added nor removed.

The poor who had nothing to their name and were below the rest. Then there were those in the middle who were the majority, having money but not as much as those at the top of the hierarchy. 
This didn’t matter anymore as today the modern society would be abolished and a new society, one which was controlled by true power rather than money and connections would be born.
Even if someone in the past had the influence and money this would not matter if they could not adapt, they would simply perish if they were unable to leave behind what they had in the past and become strong enough to survive in the new world.
The same as the poor, if they were unable to seize the power to change their fate and remain as the ants in society they would also die, however if they were able to break away from the inferiority they felt in the past and gain true power to become strong enough to survive in this new world.
In this new world nobody held an advantage and it was those who took the risks and fought with everything on the line including their lives that reaped the rewards and benefits while those who hid away and risked nothing would in turn gain nothing and remain at the bottom of this new world unable to change their fate.
Whether they were a man or woman, rich or poor, a CEO or an employee all people within this new society were equal when the time would come and only those who were brave enough to control their fate would be able to stand on top of the world and claim whatever they wanted.",47

Then there's Jerome, who just happened to be at the wrong place (sneaking into a top-secret government facility) at the wrong time (when it was guarded, aka all the time).
Can he make it in this fantastic new world?  More importantly, will he stay a child, or will he become the hero that New Australia needs?

 This is a story that develops many of the things I wanted to see in xianxia/xuanhuan (there is no xianxia tag so I went with wuxia) but never saw in a prominent role, or not prominent enough
There is development of magic technology like talismans and rationalizations to some aspects of cultivation
There are explanations to how a cultivation technique actually works… it works with magic but there are explanations of how that magic behaves
There is an answer to the nonsense of being eternally cultivating just to reach the next level
With armies fighting instead of lone murderhobos
With base building and technomagic production
In a setting that is a mixture of western and oriental fantasy so expect to see magical jades and adamantite weapons

16791,REND,"An unusual party of self-righteous vigilantes, seasoned killers and conflicted souls gathers around a mysterious warrior priestess on her way to the end of the world. While their past remains their own, the future of these men and women now rests in the hands of a sinister creature endowed with the smile of an angel, the heart of a demon and the strength to tear apart them both, should they dare to challenge her.
Whatever lies beyond remains to be seen, but with the known world drowned in blood and endless warfare, the promise of a fresh start seems alluring to those who have grown tired of it all. And it helps that the priestess has a way of convincing people that they want to help her. 
All that she requires in return is their loyalty. Until death... and sometimes beyond.
A good commander can inspire his people to greatness, but it takes a truly great one to inspire strangers. Likewise it requires a just and compassionate leader to rule an empire, but a ruthless one to create it.
*REND is set in the same universe as my other story, but there will be a lot of lore changes. Still, The Better Side of Evil is going to remain up for the time being as I feel it deserves to stay around for those who might want to check it out.

16830,special mage,"-the empty vessel theory-
 
A true empty vessel is quiet.
If you are loud without ability, you are bound to be watched by others. People catch up fast listening to the sounds the empty vessel makes.
I've seen lots of empty vessels die out in my life. In occasions where they could have passed just by staying quiet, they ruined up their chances by standing out and failing. I had to look at those people with both eyes open.
A empty vessel needs to know how to appeal itself to others, without letting others notice too much.
The ability to step behind in the most important moments, wordings that make you look like something. And the most important thing is...
to not lie.
A true empty vessel should always have a escapeway for itself. The moment of carelessness when it thinks it has decieved all others will ruin all that it has earned.
People call me as a genius that would only come out once in a thousand years. It is a problem since I am a genius in other ways from what others think.
A genius wizard who mastered the 7th circle at the age of 17.
People know me as that. Don't doubt it, as I said, I don't lie. Of course, that is not all of the truth.
On top of that truth, there is a small problem. A problem so critical, I had to decide to live as a empty vessel rather than live a fancy life.
Well, this is me.
Nothing special, nothing surprising, right?

No mere mortal nor a mere god could achieve such strength, much less rival it. In fact, it wasn't this tyrannical strength I feared so much, it is the one who holds it. I swear by the law on my follower's belief, that I would and will never forget that night for the rest of my life. The true fearsome power held by an unfathomable existence. Nothing in existence should hold such a power, and nothing should have such cruelty and high bearing. I have felt fear and will never forget it. Yet even now, I still feel the phantom pains from the limbs you ate and the heart you crushed; are you satisfied? Titan!."" - Unknown God

Special thanks to Mikaelle for the Synopsis.
This is my first book/fic so constructive critisism would be very nice. Expect a lot of grammatical errors but hopefully not too many spelling errors.
Explanation for the tags; Action/Adventure/Fantasy: These don't really need an explanation, Comedy: I'll try to be funny hopefully I won't fail miserably, Romance: I like romantic sub-plots, LitRPG: No explanation needed but I am using my own system, Reincarnation/Summoned Hero: Not sure which one applies here I'm inclined to think both so I put both, Reader Interactive: I put this one here for my own amusment I'll allow everyone to help create the MC's love interest and maybe a few other things we will also hold a few contests.. Male Lead: self explanitory, Magic: Also easy, Strong Lead: Think of this as more of a weak-to-strong tag the MC will be OP but not till later in the story.
Warning: Since this fic is labeled as 'Strategy' I believe that the readers should know as much as possible about the situations presented in the story so they can reach their own conclusions about how a fight could have been won or lost. That means: there are a lot of information dumps early on.
I don't know how long I'll be able to write this fic but I promise to keep my few readers informed in case I decide to drop it or something.",865

After being kicked out of the orphanage due to turning 15, Lino finds himself stranded on the streets. With motivation to become the best blacksmith in the world, he seeks to become a disciple of the Bridge Village's best blacksmiths, only to be kicked out of all of them. He soon finds himself roaming the streets aimlessly on an empty stomach, jobless, peniless and homeless. After hiding himself in an alley when night fell, the reality finally catches up to him - he was truly alone.
Yet, morning come, he is greeted by a knee of an old man who, after beating him for sleeping in the old man's 'backyard', takes him in. Finally being given a helping hand, he clutches tightly onto it, becoming the old man's disciple and learning the ways of the crafting, naturally while flirting with the old man's wife in his free time.
Little did he know that this encounter would spark an adventure that would take him to the heights he never believed even existed, and would let him meet people he'd only read about in the books. It's a story of Lino - an orphaned child who would come to be known by many names, but only one that he'd ever truly accept: Empyrean Blacksmith.

We became desperate, we search and search for new resources for us to exploit, but we never found them. Until someone thought of something.
""The society of the past even though they had different problems, they must have an answer to their conundrum. Perhaps we can use them too.""
We continue our research, nights and days have passed, however all of our research only lead to one thing and one thing only the Philosopher's Stone. It could generate energy without having to take any energy. Basically, it broke The Laws of Thermodynamic and Einstein's Law Conservation of Mass Energy, no, all the rule and law that we know of, doesn't apply to the Philosopher's Stone.
But how? Where can we found this crimson colored gem?
 
2094 ADWe the researchers at the Genesis Lab finally found our answer. The Philosopher's Stone is not a Gem or any other precious mineral. It is an Organism, that can replicate itself perpetually. Our greedy minds have already started thinking of various thing especially about 'how can we abuse this poor thing' kind of thought.
We can feed them to livestock.
Additionally the excrement of those livestock can be used as a fertilizer.
Voila! Infinite food and oxygen.
But still, we don't know where to find this crimson colored life-form.
 
Spring 2095 ADWE FINALLY DID IT!When we are deciphering some sort of ancient text related to the Mayans, we found out about where it was and how can we obtained it. The method that ancient people used seems to utilize human sacrifice as an offering to Gods. But hey, now we know that Gods exist, and more importantly Their whereabouts. If the ancient people used human sacrifice as the toll to open the portal. Then, we the modern people could simply use some sort of mini-sized black hole with specific coordinate to force this hidden life-form come to this world. Fundamentally, we just needed to mimic the portal that Gods himself open to answer their offering.
Allright, let's do this.

16929,Mystic ink: Mother's word.,"This is going to be based on vladerag's story Mystic ink. I'd rather call it an expanded universe, however I believe calling it a fanfiction will get the point across. Mystic Ink
This will be non cannon and can be considered entirely seperate from vladerag's actual plotline. (though there is communication with him for keeping the story inside his realm of realism and setting)
The story itself will focus on "" Cassandra's chosen children."" A cult led by Mystic ink's main character - Cassandra; with the focus of her backround machinations towards Hall's (her master and lover) advancement in society and his ambitions. Probably, I have no idea where this is going.
As it stands, what I intend to write will be pure wish fulfillment regarding certain aspects regarding Mystic ink. How far I take this and what kind of a plot will be revealed; I have no idea, I promised Vladerag something and here it is.
Synopsis:
 While Mother entertains the faulty fat pig's of the lands court, we innovate that magic she stole from the fool's who tried to tie her down, we study what she has birthed from mana. Be it nobles, kingdoms or law's; nothing will stop her, her dream and her love for all people. With every Glyph, Catalyst, or Item we re-invent or innovate, we the Sisters grow closer to her, With every obstacle that falls we the Brothers grow closer to her. 
We the Family are devout to Mother; for her words are the only truth this world has given us; Mothers first words, the doctrine we live by: ""What are your dreams, my beloved children? We know suffering and strife, but what if we hold love in our hands? I will make a world filled with love and dreams for all, so hold my hands tightly; we will change this world.""",2
16932,Lacraea: The Slow Journey To riches [HIATUS],"Darren was  a successful businessman, founder of the biggest publishing studio AoE studios. He lived a good life that is, until he dies.
He's given a choice. either he goes to the traditional heaven, where theres no internet, TV , meat, and sex OR he goes to a fantasy world like the many his company has published. Defeat a big bad boss and become  filthy rich. Theres a catch though.
unlike fantasy games, the people here are not NPCs to be trifled with mundane quests, the lowest level monsters that are usually cannon fodder in games are strong and fight for their lives like any living being would, The harsh economy of medieval times, the various languages and cultures of different races, and the politics and intrigue playing in the background with a war looming on the horizon. Oh and no respawns.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
No OP characters, No chosen one,and  no ""oh I did something that MILLIONS of other people just didn't think to do"". I am also going to try my best to stick with realism. what a guy transported to medieval times would likely do with zero knowledge of cultures or combat aside from a few TV shows.

16945,Red,"Disclaimer: I'm not continuing this story. Check out Azarinth Healer, it's a more current story where I worked on a lot of things I found wrong with this one. Main character is somewhat similar as well so if you like Eleonora, you'll probably like Ilea. I still invested a ton of time writing this so check it out if you feel like it. There's gonna be 20 Chapters 39k words total.
 
Hey everyone. This is a story I've started writing like a year ago and thought why not post it now.
This story is about fighting and magic in a pretty standard fantasy world. The story follows Eleonora through her daily life in Duneswatch and on her way to become an adventurer. No secrets here, it's pretty generic.
Should be decently paced so just give it a shot if you want to. I'm not gonna sell it to you in this quick summary. The range of writing on RR is so wide we both know you just have to give it a chapter...or a paragraph depending on how unique the grammar is.
Please do criticize harshly. I'm definitely no writer but everybody can improve with pointers in the right direction. Don't expect regular updates.",34
16946,Azarinth Healer,"Heya. 
The heavily edited version of the story will slowly be published through Kindle and Kindle Unlimited (there will be Audiobooks too). Due to exclusivity for the infinite money glitch that is Kindle Unlimited, the heavily edited section of the story will be exclusive to Amazon but a small cut of each sale goes to Royalroad.

Next to the published book on Amazon, I only post Azarinth content on Royalroad, Scribblehub, and Patreon.



A new world with nearly unlimited possibilities. A status, classes, magic and monsters. Sounds good? Well, for Ilea it didn't come quite as expected as for some other protagonists, nor was there a king or god to welcome her.
The grand quest? Well, she might figure that out someday but for now, a new world with new food is prize enough. Her fists at the ready, she's prepared to punch and get punched, however long it takes and however many limbs she might have to regrow.
A story I've started writing now quite a while ago. Transported to another world, somewhat standard fantasy setting with my beginner attempts to make it dark but funny. There are Litrpg elements here but I do hope it's not too heavy and annoying. The fights should be interesting and aren't just numbers vs numbers. Contrary to the title the protagonist will be quite an offensive fighter.
Ilea Spears is your average sarcastic kick-boxing fast food worker and soon to be student. She will be transported to another world rather conventionally and will be confronted with survival in the wild.
Give it a shot and let me know what you think. My experience is incredibly lacking. If you find yourself hating it early on, do convey your anger in a detailed comment or review :) I want to get better but without any feedback it's simply quite difficult.
Quick heads up: Around chapter 120 there are a bunch of longer PoV changes that I discontinued again shortly after. The Arc around chapters 150-200 is darker than the rest and the themes shift quite a bit. Just know that it goes back to what you've come to know after that section.
Thank you for reading.
Quick update June 2019: Many complaints regarding the formatting, specifically spacing in conversations and of course the usage of the present tense in the first 36 chapters have been addressed. I'm of course learning by the day but compared to how it was before it should be an improvement at least.

If you were transported to another world, to be an RPG protagonist.  Just another average weak human being, with nothing but ten copper coins and a crappy sword.  Could you defeat demons, monsters and giants? I think not.
In a world inhabited by all manner of unspeakable evil, by devils of both monster and man.  Could you right wrongs and fix a broken world? I think not.
When both your fellow man, demons and the very divines that hold reality together conspire to corrupt, extort and rape this world.  When they toy with you and laugh in amusement as you dance in their palms. Could you alter fate? I think not.
So when this is the thorny path ahead of our protagonists, why would you expect them to be able to?  They’re just human after all, teenagers at that.
Nevertheless,  join me on an epic journey that will alter the course of history and reality itself as our protagonists show you what it really means to be human... in an inhuman world.",40

The child of a hero shares in his final moments. The world is often a cold, unforgiving place and yet... for some few chosen souls, the souls of heroes and the souls of the innocent, there are those who are willing to stand against the whims of the fates.

""Teacher X!""

""Good answer, Karen. Yes as he says, in short, mysteries are there for us to solve. In today's lesson, we will be focusing on the mysteries of the human mind. Well, you could also say this is a lesson about reality itself, but that's for later. Now, why do we feel sad when tragedy befalls us? Why do we feel happy when wants are fulfilled? Why? Try this thought experiment, class. Imagine experiencing many trials that will test the limit of the human mind. What do you think the end result of these trials will be? What will you gain?

--Excerpt from ""The Folly of Man"" Author Unknown.
 
The most powerful person in the world stood on the precipice of Apotheosis. So great was their power that with a single wave this person felled empires that stood for millenia. When they stormed the Mountain of the Gods they had arrayed with them the combined might of a thousand peoples... and they were refused.
The deities cast them down and barred them from the power they once held, citing hubris and arrogance as lessons yet to be learnt by mankind. Thus legends ended, heroes died, and hope faded.
---
Thousands of years after the loss of magic in all its glory the world has forgotten it. They build towering structures of glass and steel, wield weapons forged by the million, and kill at the press of a button. The seals are breaking, and what was once impossible will cease to be so. What once was the crucible of gods and heroes will be again.
It all awaits at the Edge of the World.

This is a learning process, and mistakes are made, but they grow, learn, and adapt to these difficulties in ways that some might say only young people can.
While it may look it at first, this is not intended as a sad story, merely an honest one. I wanted to make the characters human, and unfortunately, that means that difficulties hit them in very real ways through the story, but then again, they have some equally human moments of warmth between one another as they grow.
Triggers: Explores the aftereffects and recovery process of sexual abuse, and some other forms of physical abuse. I like to think I avoided making it edgy, but you deserve to be informed. Some readers have told me that it can feel a bit too real at times. A bit too honest.

Winning fights is a lot easier if you have the powers of an apex predator at your disposal...but it'll be a long journey to reach that point. A freshly-hatched dragon can only do so much.
Drew has always considered violence a last resort. Why turn to fists (or claws) when a more thoughtful and creative solution might be possible? But bloodless pacifism isn't exactly an option in a world of obligate carnivores, and the choice is often one between eating and being eaten. If a life of quiet contemplation and study is still within reach, it will be a long road to get there.

Re: Dragonize is a LitRPG progression fantasy starting with a protagonist who must start at the bottom (or close to it), and work gradually upwards, making incremental progress with plenty of setbacks along the way.

I hope that this book will help all of us come to terms with the realities that we face today or deal with some of our deepest feelings about the past. Maybe these people lied to us and maybe they honestly believed the myriad of things they told us, but either way I think we can have a good laugh looking back and remembering the first times that we realized these things weren't true. I also hope that you can look back at the lies, or life lessons, that you've learned and can be inspried to own your stories and share them with others in a genuine way.

Although seeing dimensions of reality were usually in the threads dimension, which Tib used most since it was the simplistic way of seeing and controlling things out of the bunches of numbers, equations, science, and many other things. 
Today, he seems to want to go explore the Harry Potter universe, or any random alternate HP universe.

For Yuel, a team sport is like a chessboard that comes to life. There’s no greater fun than deconstructing every opponent and predicting twenty of their moves in advance.
And, Classmancers is the ideal stage for such psychological warfare, for it’s a sport in which game theory reigns supreme. At least, usually, it does.

However, to challenge their OPness, the two will run into rivals who are just as OP! Some of them will turn their teammates immune to Yuel’s psychological attacks, while others will redirect Lars’s almighty strength against himself.
In this harsh environment, the two will keep struggling, struggling, and struggling some more, following their promise to reach the pro scene.

Though no one outside of the Pentagon has ever heard of him, he protected his homeland from three ICBMs, a Pacific theatre invasion fleet, and one rogue asteroid. Now, after twenty-seven years of distinguished service from ""birth,"" he is being honorably discharged into civilian life.
The only problem is that ""civilian life"" isn't exactly livable for a glorified brain in a jar. How does a couple pounds of grey matter surrounded by five tons of life support systems and enough co-processing enhancements to take over the planet enjoy an early retirement when he's surrounded by overzealous politicians, corporate spies, and foreign agents after military secrets?

Outcast, cold, loner, and more were words that usually were used to describe Rej as a child as jealousy and other negative emotions came easily to people since he almost never had any trouble with anything as Rej learned everything at about 10x the rate of a genius of geniuses.
But because of his isolation, and lack of human interaction, he was helpless in the matter of how actual people thought like. But, Rej was also pure as because of his thirst of knowledge, he knew that people couldn't help with these emotions and decided to become the one that people would admire.
Rej would be the one to help others and bring happiness to others even at his own expense, but he only did these things on a whim as they also brought a smile to his face, so he wasn't a complete saint as he was human and also had his own desires. But he was immortal, and was only mortal to his own intent, so everyone knew the outcome of Rej being depressed and bored with life after a few thousand years of boredom.
But with his own death, and the death of his own mind, a new mind was made with the same soul as the core. This new mind also had experienced the experiences of the soul but responded with different wants and needs to those memories and decided to act not as a person to admire, but one did whatever he wanted and would sometimes be called a monster and sometimes called a savior those who were lucky and unlucky. Although, there might be more unlucky as this was a newborn mind who only had a moment of life before experiencing this soul.

If one was to truly do what they wanted, they would be called both the lord and the devil, as their emotions and wants dictated their logic, and those who truly do what they want, have the power to change all at a whims notice.

17318,Incarnation Of The One,"In ancient times, the dark forces tried to consume the world.
They managed to swallow large parts of the universe, their corruption taking hold in almost every living thing.
On the brink of successfully subduing the whole of creation, an inconspicuous girl appeared, out of nowhere. No one paid her any heed at first, but then the corruption began to fade in her wake. Where ever she tread, the dark forces lost their hold upon the living.
Panicking, they confronted her directly, something that had never happened in all of time. In the end, the dark gods battled her on a planet in the outskirts of the universe.. and lost.
Since that day, the girl became known as The One.
The One, that saved creation.
The One, that can't be corrupted.
The One, that can't be subdued.
A problem arose, however. While she had defeated the foe, even she was incapable of ridding reality from them completely. So she decided to sacrifice her livelihood to build a cage, a seal, able to withstand the never ending tide of maddening chaos. To protect every part of reality, the seal was split and scattered across the stars.
The planet where the last battle was held, became a prison world, and a grave.
A prison to the black gods.
A grave to The One.
All of this happened a few hundred thousand years ago. Now, no living thing knows of The One any more. Or of the great danger she banned from the world.
Watch, as yet another inconspicuous girl appears out of nowhere, and stirs up the oldest secret, that was meant to be forgotten.",6

Friends...
Acquaintances...
And...
The internet...
That last part was just because Hendrick was hooked to the internet or about 15 hours a day, every day...Hendrick himself was surprised by the fact that he didn't die from other causes, but at least he knows he was lucky enough to die by God's hands.
Hendrick himself knew that he was going to abuse the heck(you know you'll send it back if I put that curse word there) out of his wishes, first things first, his first wish was going to be un--
God has now sent Hendrick to that world without a second thought, but he did have second thoughts on whether or not it was a good idea to give him unlimited wishes...

Opening your eyes is painful when you're used to the dark. Especially for a grand hermit like myself. I swear, I haven't had eye contact with Thormir in years. Ugh.
Now, you may be wondering to yourself, why would a hermit possibly ever open their eyes in the wretched presence of Thormir himself, much less record it and chance leaking their experience, but truth be told I am on the run. No ordinary chase either, no Sir, I am running from Mortalis herself. I remember when my only pursuers were mere demons and empires. Those were the good days. Now I lack the concept of a sanctuary and a good night's rest is a dream in and of itself.
I remember when closing my eyes for a brief respite from my flight didn't end in a stinging reminder of my precarious situation. At least it was worth it, I got out with these blessed bits of ordered chaos.

 Behind him, pass the great colomns of the royal hall, the sound of iron gates could be heard opening. A silhouette could be seen, making its way towards the old man. It was thin, and ran with long strides. Its arms stayed down at its sides. It was only a matter of time until it was upon the book keeper. 
The old man fell onto his back, slamming into the ground and screamed out. He turned his head and looked at the dark figure. 
""Demon! Spy! May God have mercy on your soul for this!"" Cried out the old man, still clutching onto the book. The candle had fallen from his hand when he had fallen, and rolled onto one of the curtains of a nearby window. It was now catching fire.
The old man crawled backwards, his face horrified, as he kept eye contact with the black form. Before he could crawl any further, he slammed into one of the columns. He clutched onto the book with both arms. The entire curtain was now engulfed in flames. Fire and embers floated about in the dark hall. 
 
The dark firgure stood in the shadows, not walking out into the light. Slowly, a deep, thunderous voice snarled from the silhouette.
 
""God has no jurisdiction over me. I am a God."" Then the being slowly started to rise. He was no longer on the ground. The old man went pale. His hands went white, as he clutched onto the book with all his strengh. The dark form looked down at him. Slowly one of its arms started to extend. It grew out, worming its way down towards the old man. Snake like, the arm took hold of the old man. It lifted him off the ground, keeping him pinned to the column. The book keeper screamed in agony as his back grated against the sharp edges of the column. The old man reached into his pocket and pulled out a small knife, mean't for opening letters. He slashed out at the arm. It did nothing. The knife went up into flames as soon as it made contact with the dark being. The metal melted away, dripping onto the floor.
The dark form yelled out in laughter. ""You fool, no man can kill me."" Then the dark form came out into the light. The old man's eyes opened wide. Then his body went limp. The book fell from his arms, down onto the stone floor. 
 
 The King awoke, his castle alarm blaring. Soldiers were running about, getting into battle formations. Servents ran about in all directions, most of them screaming. 
""General!"" yelled out the king, as he placed his robes on and walked out into the great hall. In the hall soldiers now surrounded the room, spears pointed out. Most of the room was on fire now. 
""What the bloody hell is going on?"" demanded the king. The general looked to the king, then back to the center of the hall. He slowly lifted a finger and pointed. There, hanging from the ceiling was the book keeper. His limp body slowly rotating back and forth. But with a closer look, you would realize there was no rope keeping him up. He was suspened in the air, dead. There was no book to be found.",2

But there is a solution, and that is 'Reincarnation'. Although the body is broken, the soul is preserved until a new body is created for it to inhabit, the cycle continues on and on and hence why humans multiply day by day.
'Reincarnation' is believed to be the work of the 'Gods' humans worship so much.
But is it true? 'Gods', 'Demons', 'Hell', 'Heaven', do they really exist? 
I for sure, do not believe in such things. After all, there is no concrete proof. 'Reincarnation', is what I believe in. Not only is it an interesting concept, but it is something I have experienced.
Every night, I have dreams of what I believe to be my previous lifetimes. Some memories are hopelessly vague but the others are incredibly vivid. The movie like scenes carve themselves into my head and the moment I open my eyes, the experiences stay permanently registered in my brain, and all the skills and abilities the person had will naturally come to me and it would feel as if they were my own. The memories of strange places, people, and events felt so foreign yet so familiar, it was contradicting.
I believe for 'Reincarnation' to be a natural law of the universe, rather than being managed by some 'Gods' that probably don't even exist.
'God' created humans? More like man created 'God'.
Enough with that, do you know what I detest the most? Humans.
Humans are greedy, selfish, cruel and all the horrible traits you can think of. Of course, they also have their good traits. But even so, it will never rid of my hate for humanity.

This Sunday however is not as usual as it may seem, and Elijah is about to painfully find this out as his whole life and the life of everything and everyone he holds dear will forever be changed.

She just knows that all her life she's been surrounded by the unnatural - like a golden fuzzball of a childhood companion she calls a faerie, or the fact that her estranged grandmother came to her as a ghost with a cryptic message - you know, the usual paranormal activities that she's done well to hide. 
And just when Miranda's finally got her sense of sanity downpact, her family uproots and moves into her dead grandmother's home and for reasons that just do not make sense.What's worse? How about a series of animal attacks on the town as soon as she arrives?  Add in her mother’s incessant nagging about Hindu faith, mediocre high school torment, a handsomely flirtatious tutor, and an obnoxious Sheriff who’s already got her pegged as the culprit behind these attacks, then it’s no wonder why all Miranda wants is to keep a low-profile.
But of course, life has other plans and Miranda's going to have to trust in her strange abilities in order to rise to challenge, otherwise fall victim to the chaos within her sanity and her reality.",0

The story centers around the main protagonist, who is the beginning of everything. Life isn't easy, not even as a god. Everything has to start somewhere and will end somewhere. The only difference is the way you take. The storyline will often be told by the people around the MC because it makes the story more interesting this way.

Author's note ?: Hoping to update this with at least one chapter every two days and chapters should range from 1000 to 2000 words.
Even though English is my first language, unlike a lot of authors on this website, beware as I tend to miss out words in sentences. This can become annoying, and I try my best to spot them, but some will eventually leak through so if you do spot a missing word, just comment on it and I will change it.
Also, I welcome criticism, but please be constructive as I hope to get better at writing as time progresses. :)

the synopsis and title will probably change later on
And I think it gets better after arc 1 ch 3 
The real story won't begin untill the heroes are summoned so you may feel a little bored while Im building the world and te mc' s personality.
I wanted to state that this novel will start with a lighter tune but then get dark real fast.
For the sexual content: it wont happen untill much longer. And when it happens it wont be overly explicit.
Gore and traumatising content: It wont be at the level of nauseous but it may be too so just to be safe.
This is my first try on writing novels so I welcome all of your criticism either good or bad.

Thus, I will reboot the series when I have smoothed out the details instead of writing and posting drafts that aren't thoroughly planned with care. Until then, all chapters will be deleted.)

Ok, do not panic, calm down and assess the situation....F$@# THAT. This would be a perfectly normal situation where I should panic...even though if I don't know if this qualifies as a NORMAL situation.
Ok, here's what I know (which isn't much)1. I died and got killed by Truck-kun (anime meme, look it up)2. I got reincarnated (Yay! Cool, another shot at life...but)3. In a reverse harem manga I was reading before I died (Awesome, handsome bishounens here I come!....but)4. BUT AS THE F$%@$#% RIVAL-CHAN!!!!
Before I died the manga I was reading called Cupid Lover: First Shot Ai or just First Shot Ai, finally updated its last few chapters. The story circles around the cute, cupid angel in training Usagi Hana-chan being assigned to pair cool;rebellious Kitsune Daiki. Eventually they fall in love after many obstacles and finally defeat me, the final boss, the anti-cupid who's sole goal is to ruin all relationships for god knows what reason, Amaya Raz(aline)-chan.

But Amaya just got booted from both the heavens and the human world and sent into exile in the Split between worlds...but...wait...a character died there..
NO.NO.NO. I don't wanna be exiled and die!!! I mean, uh..redemption right? The other characters got it!! I STILL HAVE TWO MORE CHAPTERS, C'MON GOODIE TWO SHOES USAGI OPEN YOUR DAMN HEART!!!! Two chapters...I still have hope....
No, I gotta take this into my own hands, like hell I'm going to get exiled and die. Go ahead and be lovey dovey on your own I'm going to go and travel the world or something!
 
Authors Notice:
(IMPORTANT AT THE END. PLS READ!!!)
There will be some anime references and other references. I’ll try to add the meanings in at the end of each chapter. 
I plan to make th story a slow progression type of story with a lot of details and a ratio of 3/5 inner dialogue 2/5 talking. I don’t plan on doing fillers and want to het straight to the point. 
A good example of these types of story styles is the one with Koushoin Reika. A lot a chapters, fun and interesting. 
Each character, moment, and thing is important and put in their for a reason.
MOST IMPORTANTLY. I like to draw (and fix my mistakes if they are pointed out to me.) so I will be going back and adding things on old chapters sometimes. If you want to see the drawing to help with visuals, go ahead and look. 
I cannot promise that they are good and may ruin what you think the characters should look like.

But only the rich or truly dedicated can afford their own cutting-edge full immersion pods. Everyone else will have to make due with renting time at company-owned game centers in major cities around the world.Alexander and Alexandra are in the former category after a lucky lottery win catapulted them to the life, if not lifestyle, of the idle rich. They join the game on launch day, but circumstances and differing interests start them on completely different paths.Will the twins reunite in the game, or will they continue on their separate ways, only meeting across the dinner table outside virtual reality?

Unique achievements and server firsts do abound, but the main characters only capture a few of them; they aren't the only players in the world, after all!    ----    Intended update schedule is currently the 10th, 20th, and 30th of each month once or twice a month, probably at irregular timing, but variable schedules and other commitments may interfere.",321

17462,Needs More Monsters,"Usually only considered as a last resort, artificially accelerating the creation of a dungeon core is not a task to be taken lightly. There's only one way for it to go right and a thousand and one ways for it to go wrong. Mess it up and, rather than some ancient spirit rendered little more than a beast by aeons spent dead, you might invoke the soul of a power hungry Warlock, still fully possessed of all his ambitions and now in control of one of the most dangerous artefacts in the known world. Your spectacular failure could result in the beginning of a new age of Darkness.Or you could get some milquetoast shlub who's more concerned about people falling down the ominous entrance stairs.Needs More Monsters is intended as a non-standard take on the usual Dungeon Core formula, inspired primarily by There is no Epic Loot here, Only Puns.",60

Alice stares into his eyes, two swirling maelstroms of energy akin to the sun. Her decision was made years ago, and it was written in reinforced steel.
The Jester turns from her gaze. ""Very well, we shall test your mettle with three tasks. If you survive all three, you will evolve to a state words cannot explain. And should you fail, you will simply be another farmer's daughter, dead and burried in an unmarked grave. Now follow me, we have a ways to travel.""
Alice kept her icy gaze on the Jester, however inside she was as the first day of spring, the ice that had embraced her life for years was now finally melting away as sprouts of hope slowly made their way to the surface. Whatever these tasks, that manifested themselves as shadowy gateways in her mind, proved to be, she would prevail.

My little brother has spinabifida, which is a birth defect that leaves him paralyzed from the waist down.

Most called him a monster and psycho for killing those that arguably changed many lives for the better but there were very few that had known the wicked sins of those he had murdered. Whether he was justified in his actions mattered little to both the powerful and afraid VIPs that wanted him gone.
 After his unfortunate end, Colt was greeted by nothing except darkness and the voice of what he believed to be a very old man. It demanded to be entertained and it was high time that Colt repaid the generosity given to him, the voice claimed. Constant intense flashes of blinding light mixed with the cursed demands from the voice brings Colt to shut down entirely. After what seems like a fever dream, Colt forces his heavy eyes open to find out that he was now in a vibrant forest with a much younger body that doesn't seem to be fully human. Without out even a sliver of advice or assistance from the voice, Colt must now understand the new possibilities(as well as the dangers) that this strange place has in store for him.

                Note---------- If you read ""The Ash Eel"" around 4 years ago and are hoping that it will follow the same MC as before, I am sorry to say that will not be the case for Colt 2.0. I want this character to have at least some sort of depth and likability, unlike Colt 1.0. Some ideas for power will stay and others have been scrapped due to how completely overpowered they are. Not to say he won't be strong later but a kid(In my opinion) isn't going to have the ability or strength to overpower an adult that can fight actually fight back, no matter what ""gifts"" or powers he/she may have.
The story will be much slower and drawn out compared to what was before to hopefully show just how strong these characters can become. I have hopes to make this a decently long read for those of you that enjoy.. well reading I guess.
FYI------ Still pretty new to actually making a story and trying to bring it life somehow so I would appreciate more critique than insults if possible. If there are any spelling mistakes you care to point out just lemme know and I'll get to it.

Oh yeah, I forgot to mention they are born into this world as a cactus.
What to expect:-
- Mc is not OP, if cuteness is OP then he's OP
-Strategy based rather than a head on fight.
-Good charecter development (atleast trying for it) (???< )
- it's a bit full of chaos in the beginning (cause of reasons), but if ya stick around I think you'll enjoy the story.
-Some sinister web spinning in the background~
-Inspired from Kono suba and Re:Zero, This novel is more realism based than pure power of love and friendship~

To the various species that called this world, one of seven, home, the matter seemed beyond insignificant. 
The hatchling, like all monsters, had no divine backing and with its age, could only be considered a lesser existence. A being to be used by the Chosen and noble monster bloodlines in their never-ending pursuit of power, fame and immortality.
However, how could any of the short-lived races, Chosen and Monster alike, know that the tiny, weak, lizard-like creature was much more than it seemed. That it was an entity only spoken of in myth and legend. From a species that their ancestors, with the backing of the Gods, paid a huge price to remove. A heretical existence that threatened the fragile peace that had descended upon their world.

""The final year of high school is the most difficult.""
This statement has never been truer for Damis, a student attending one of the many schools in the City of Sundridge.
He never wanted anything more than to live a peaceful life, going so far as to avoid having large group of friends, indulging in dragged out conversations, or being involved in any other activity that requires him to invest a large amount of effort to accomplish.
Instead, he poured all of his efforts into studying, dwelling in his internal monologues, and complaining about the things that annoy him to his one and only friend, Noah.
Before long, he ended up as one of the best students in his class.
As far as he was concerned, he was content with how he lived.
But, after a confrontation with an eccentric girl named May, one of his classmates since the first year of high school, things have suddenly gotten out of hand.
And as a result, his life became a lot more hectic than it used to be.
Bound by a deal he could not refuse, his life as May's assistant began.
At this rate, can he still spend the final days of his high school life in peace?
Welcome to the life of Damis, the boy who's always A Step Behind Death.

So in ages so long and distant the memories most couldn’t recall, the kingdom turned upon itself. War raged for many years, no one coming close to being considered a victor, it appeared that this self-destruction would go on till nothing was left.
Many if given the chance would have claimed that would have been a mercy for this kingdom and its people.  For as they killed, and butchered each other over things they already had. Vibrations traveled through rock and stone guiding things best left alone. Creatures came things of horror armed to the teeth with claws, fangs, and armor. Cities fell and were consumed not even the bones of individuals remained, for these creatures hunger knew no limits, had no end. The kingdom rallied together once more, what was left, they fought and fought but their Nightmare had no end. Their greatest, brightest minds worked their magic, carved into stone. Wards they called them, this would keep their Nightmares away. They abandoned attempts to fight and focused on walling every surface of the kingdom with these Wards. It worked mostly, an illusion of peace returned, one that crumbled often, but it was better than before, it was a bearable hell now.

Not a hero, neither a villain, just a human flesh and blood, accomplishing what governments in years couldn't.

17675,L,"Goodmen, beware,
L is no hero. Some spun tales of his deeds benefiting one circle or another, but in the end, his actions benefit none but himself, for any particular occasion where his farce contributes something of substance, it would be nothing but a false, perpetual coincidence, hiding naught but the blatant desire of chaos and depravity. There is no heroism in his dark deeds, to his twisted lies and fabricated truths. We have seen his kind before, have felt the typhoons they are born within. He, through and through, to the smallest pieces of his wretched blood cells, is a lecherous entity which does not care for the world, his, ours, or the people that reside within it--if he even considers them to be so. My unreliable sources have shown otherwise.
This is not a heroic tale, yet I hesitate to deem it villainous either, for his intentions are incomprehensible. I retrieved his history from the fires he laid behind him, from the ruination of his tongue and sword, but his House is a subject in which even I do not dare to tread about. Let a different dolt ravage their mind in separating their fictions from their sins. I repeat, foolhardy learners, that this is a tragedy about an extremely patronizing human-like figure, who seems to account for naught but his own whimsical, impetuous, sinister desires; no matter the unfortunate outcome, for him, or for others.
Yet there, within the tribulations, lies a wicked lesson. It is hence I sacrificed my clear-mindedness in inscribing this, in an attempt to whisk the ramifications from the muck and excrement.
I have failed.
Goodmen, stay away, for insanity beckons his footsteps. They reside within his words, within his acts, and within his story. It is here, on these rotten pages in this very tome of misery.
Goodmen, I beg of you: Beware and begone.
 
 
THE 7 REALLY IMPORTANT STHINGS

Synopsis. So, basically, I’ve gotten tired of all these stale mcs that keep popping up left right and center. Either they are painstakingly good-natured or horribly written ‘evil’ characters. So, here’s my take on the concept of a Villain. Someone ruthless, cunning, and not shy of seeking darker means to an end. Hell, as long as it’s effective, he’ll prefer the blacker side of business.
The new world will be, like many others, one in a medieval-type setting with traces of magic and the like; though I hope to make better use of this than most others who simply steal ideas from classical novels or other sources.",67

This fiction will contain explicit sexual and voilent content! (Mostly nudity and people's heads becoming bloody piles of meat)
Ancient japan, two-thousand-three-hundred years ago.

Kamis (Gods) and spirits wander across the lands and involve themselves into the bloody struggle of the mortals turning the land into a ravaged battlefield. 
In this world of gods and evil spirits the struggle over power in ancient japan forced the young girl Hina to become the servant of a wandering Kami called Shi.

Amaterasu, the sungoddess herself.
 
The novels setting is Japan's earliest written history (well it was written down by the chinese, but i guess it still counts...), to be more precise the Yamatai kingdom that reigned a large part of Japan during the 3rd century b.c. and is considered to be the first large kingdom of japan.

Will he be able to keep it a secret? Is he really the only one with this bizarre ability? What's the reason of its existence?
Everything will be answered in this light-hearted and comedic story that follows Taichi throughout his high school years as he struggles to cope with his ability to balance it and a normal teenager's life.

Note from Author - I was born in the United States, I speak english, and I'm a highschooler. No, I do not speak other languages (I just know a little Spanish), but I do love foreign translated novels. Every book has story to tell whether good or bad. There is always something you can take away from a book. This is what drives me to write my own novel and post it on Royal Road, and... I'd like to be able to make a living off of my writing.

And several years before I became an employee of theirs, this crazy ensuing madness of a Full Dive battle royale between even more companies had boiled to a breaking point; mine thought to search for something that would blow the competition out of the water.
Well, they found it. Deep under the sea actually. A true game changer. Rumors abounded of course. But the most common knowledge became that it was something like a power source and certainly unlike anything the world had seen. However, I can tell you now, the unknown sometimes bump back. Especially when experimenting on highly unknown elements.
Now, what does any of this got to do with stabbing a bear? Well, ask them that! They started it all. I’m new remember! To be frank, chaos ensued, and well, I was there. So, three of us were sent into different areas of the world.
So, this is a story of a mission to save the people in Realm of Ancients, well, it was suppose to go smoothly, but obviously stuff definitely went wrong...

***

Set in the full-dive virtual reality world of Realm of Ancients, Leo and two others were sent in when a cataclysmic event forced them to seek out the Heart of the World, where they hoped to be able to get everyone out. Yet, this fantastical world holds many secrets, and their quest is not as cut and dry as they would have believed.
The world had changed and now Leo and everyone who is set on seeing the mission through, has to fight to survive in a dangerous and uncertain world.

Hi! This is a project I have started for the fun. 
This is not your typical comedy. Yes, I added quite a bit of humour to the story, BUT as things go into the eye of the storm the character will face challenges that hits him down. So it is not a comedy really. There are big set pieces of survival, of exploration in a grand fantasy world in the game. But what do they say, when you've hit bottom, only way to go is up! :D 
I am always open to suggestions that might take the story to new heights, so you all are welcome to discuss the story in the comments. Just remember the all important SPOILER tags. ;)

He's just like any other teenager attending Haven Highschool.
Except one thing; Neo suffers from OCD, and his irky habits are solely the reason for his classmates to make fun of him. But as much as he tries to hide his annoying habits of counting literally everything, entering a class without touching the floor right in front of the first desk, tapping light button's to the beat of ""we will rock you"" and any other small tic, his fellow students know, and they use it to bully him endlessly.

All my life, it was a lonely and boring world with nothing but repetitiveness. I would get up, make breakfast, serve breakfast to my brother, eat breakfast, get to school, get bullied by the school bullies, and then go to my classes where I'm picked on further. Most of the teachers have been bribed by the guy, since his parents are the filthy rich owners of the Vortex Research company, a company that has made this era thrive with new medicine, new issues of theft, and more.
The only time I'm not bullied is when my gym and math teacher Mr. Jacobs is around. He's helped me more than I can thank him for, and this just goes further when it happened. It was a sunny day, the sky was clear and blue, and everything seemed to be normal.
However, I don't think a voice in my head, telling me that I have 5 wishes is normal. Is that normal? Maybe for some people.

17753,The Designated: Out of Control,"It happened quicker than anyone would have imagined. Multiple hurricanes were one thing. People had dealt with that in the past. But, like kids playing dominoes, one thing crashed into another. Areas affected by hurricanes needed resources all along the Gulf and East Coasts drew rescuers and resources away from other parts of the country. When wildfires lit up the Pacific coast and mid-west, those areas were already understaffed. Driven by hurricanes in the Pacific basin, uncontrolled wildfires burned through towns, destroying everything in their paths.   Across the Pacific, Asia didn't escape. From the Philippines, across China, into Indochina, and Bangladesh and India. Typhoons and cyclones pounded the coasts and far inland. Widespread flooding forced millions from their homes and across international borders. Mexico was hit hard and thousands died in mudslides as Katia slammed into their East Coast. The refugees fled north and west. Rumours started that hundreds of thousands were headed for the US border.  Instead of running out of steam in the southern US, several hurricanes tore up the eastern seaboard, devastating cities and renewing their strength before veering east across the Atlantic. Maria and Ophelia veered east and slammed into Europe, reaching as far as the Netherlands and Russia before finally dissipating. After that, too many weather stations were offline to provide any form of co-ordinated information or warnings. Wildfires in Portugal burned ahead of the storms, fanned by hurricane winds. They sparked wildfires leapfrogging across Europe, beyond any one country's ability to cope.  Already uneasy from multiple terrorist attacks over the summer, anti-refugee groups seized the opportunity to stage protests across Europe. Some turned violent as they clashed with police forces. Several governments declared martial law to quell the rioting and enforce evacuations along the path of the storms. Rumour and speculation overwhelmed facts.  Unrest spilled over into widespread violence.  Then sickness broke out in the displaced populations. 
Within a matter of a dozen weeks, tens of millions died. In the coming winter months hundreds more would follow.  
The Designated Project was activated.",8

You see I get more energy every day, it's a set amount. I can stockpile it or burn it all up on one giant ""upgrade"" as I like to call it.

The problem with my plan is that I have some shadow organization looking for me. They'll kill me, my family, my friends, and everyone I have ever loved to get the lamp. What do they want? As far as I can tell they want to rewrite our universe into some kind of communist paradise where freewill comes second to safety and the government.

""With these gifts, I depart in aeternum, may you all remember one thing, live, feel, and grow! Nothing worse than being bored with eternal life! As the seven look at each other with their newfound powers, complete with immortality. The one bestowed Chaos looks at the others ""I think we should start by creating a universe full of magic and possibilities, and freedom. we should decide on our names, for one will stick to Chaos For that is what I have become, as Chaos finishes his last word his hair and pupils shift to a deep violet. his neck transforming and elongating, back exploding with violet light forming into leathery wings covered with scales. his mouth coming out to create a snout. teeth that extend into large predatory weapons. A tail formed from his now-massive body.
With this, he continues ""As for my contribution to the making of this new world I cannot provide earth, water, space, time, air, or even life. But for all that exists on this plane, I give to them true freedom the ability and potential to be unbound so that nothing may tether them!"" With that oath, the plane became full not of life, light, or even earth but of an energy that all beings could harness and manipulate with diligence.

The remaining six individuals begin their own metamorphosis each taking on a form they believe appealing and fitting to their newly acquired powers.",10

17896,Psyche Reflection,"In the universe, Year 20XX, there exists people who are able to enter the cognitive realms of others and alter their perceptions and emotions, for better or worse. These people are known as ""Divers""  for their ability to dive into the psyche of others in a process called the ""Psyche Dive"". The cognitive realm is unique to each individual, hence it's also named the ""Reflected World"". There, one's innermost emotions and beliefs are materialised when the balance between the id (source of psychodynamic energy, represented by our desires and individuality.) and the superego (represented by our conscience and need to conform to society) is disrupted, with the id overpowering the superego more often than not.As a result, the excess psychodynamic energy on either side results in the formation of Spectres, ghost-like beings that haunt the ego (an individual's personality) and push a person to ruin by clouding his perceptions of reality, influencing his decision making in the process. If left unchecked, Spectres would continue to grow in number and power, eventually consuming the ego completely to form Demons within the person's psyche. At this point, it is extremely difficult to restore a person's id to its original state, as Demons are often extremely powerful and well-protected by their army of Spectres.
People who are possessed by Demons are often twisted individuals who commit the most heinous of crimes, as they have lost all of their conscience and morals, fuelled only by their desires. The Divers are the last hope for humanity against the Spectres and Demons. Armed with the power to use their cognition to fashion into effective weapons against these abominations, the Divers seek to cleanse the minds of victims from such insidious influences.

Viktor and Catherine were both insane, obscene, and unruly children, so the Gods Irene and Nigel decided to reincarnate them as primordial kittens of divine holiness. Sadly, this included both of them being completely powerless to defend themselves. The duo is forced to redeem their characters: Catherine must learn to be abstemious, humble, and kind; Viktor must learn to be chaste and democratic. The journey is long, which gives plenty of time for Viktor to woo Catherine along the way, so long as both of them don't go further into insanity.

Grimdark Ash is a fantasy world that my writing takes place. In this world, there are many different creatures and systems that are common to fantasy themes. For example, there are adventurers, magic, and guilds. However, what differentiates this world from the plethora of other fantasy settings is the everlasting dark theme.

Romance is also not the main focus of the story, or isn't intended to be.Some of the tags will not make sense for a while, and may actually be removed if this does actually become a prologue to the universe or series.

I wrote and am writing this purely for my own amusement.

Don't expect too much.
That said, this mutated mistake of a short novella follows a ditzy MC who has been transported to a new world with the dubiously useful skills origin and enigma and the obnoxiously imbalanced skill, traveler.

18095,The Demonic Army from another world,"After an unfortunate event struck an unsuspecting science class, the group find themselves facing multiple gods.
Wishing for something to entertain them, each student is given a choice of either disappearing for good or being reborn as monsters in a magic&knights world.
Naturally, none choose the former option. Despite the strangeness of it all, the class decides to band together and support one another in this strange world where monsters want to eat them and humans want to butcher them.
Together we stand, united, under a common goal: survival. 

My attempt at making a 'reincarnated as a class' story. The MC will be extremely strong, but so will everyone in the class.
My goal for this story is to make the class united. There might be conflict, however, the class will always stand together, unlike most stories where the MC is either abandoned or deemed 'worthless'. In this story, respect and love between classmates is important.
That's my goal. Enjoy the story.

First thing you have to know is that it's a tragedy.
Nope, not talking about my book yet. It's a tragedy that you're reading this instead of clicking on chapter 1. I did fail speech introductions after all.
My story? Right that's what you're here for. My bad, try this:
Lilia Hammond is reborn (cliché, but we all know we enjoy it when it's done for a purpose) as Syndra Sanmey. She was a graphic designer who hadn't caught her break yet. She was paralyzed for months before she was offered the opportunity to join a program that would allow her to-NOPE! not virtual reality. The doctors killed her and dumped her body. Tough.
In her new world, Lilia has to fight herself to find out who she truly is. With the possibility to cast magic and a second chance at life, Lilia thinks she can really make something for herself. Her goal? Become the greatest artist the world had ever seen. The rub? World is a bit darker than anything she saw on earth. Thankfully, Lilia is getting quite familiar with the darkness inside her and her magic might just be the thing to save the-hey! wait it's not that kind of book.
No saving the world. No hero syndrome. Just magic and blood and a bit of crafting. Yup. Fighting. Romance? Eh? What's that?
The first arc is Lilia's shift from Earth to creating backstories for the three major characters. It's not funny and light. It's often dark and funny. Ah, I really should have gone through a punk-rock phase. Or goth. Would I look good with black hair? Hmm..
There are three MCs and they are Jackson, Daryl, and Lilia/Syndra. Daryl is currently kidnapped and Jackson just awakened his magic. I don't want to spoil (much) but soon things will be very fun to write.
Hope to see you there! Leave a comment even if you're just stopping by so I can say hey!

This was my very first large story. ;) I started writing it years ago. Was fun, was difficult, but in the end, it is a story I hope that will inspire. 
The prologue is in first person perspective and the rest of the story in 3d. Just a little heads-up :P
It is a fantasy epic with a contemporary twist for the start. The first arc of the novel is set inside our modern world, but as the mysterious events around Calin intensifies, the hidden secrets in the world start to become more fantastical.
 
The story follows Calin, a young orphan in search of answers. But, the answers he seeks will change his life and that of his friends forever, for the secrets that caused his situation have far greater ramifications than the small village of Lamb's Crest could have known. 
 Remember to leave ratings and reviews. I'm quite interested in hearing your thoughts on the story. ;)

I’m a new writer so bear with me here. If you have any comments regarding the writhing style or any corrections to the text and story, don’t hesitate to message me over them. Your input is appreciated. I have the outline of the story all mapped out and the characters set. The general direction of the story is there but some of the details will be added later on, so I’m winging it as I go.
The story may have some heavy undertones of betrayal, death, use of drugs, criminal activities and sexual content so this is a mature story. (This warning is here as a disclaimer and most of the scenes are not graphic in nature)
A warning regarding the chapters that contain such material will be posted at the top of the chapter. Such material will be kept to a minimum and will have little impact on the reader but is necessary for the development of some characters.",0

Molting the Mortal Coil is more of a slower paced journey. It's not about endless battles and conquering the next bad guy who spits on the main characters shoes or sends him a funny look. There's also not a treadmill of tournaments or love interests. It's more of a slower burn with lots of, and hopefully not too much, world building. It's still supposed to be stuffed with action, but that won't pick up for a while since we start with a weakling. The first 30 chapters have a lot of time-skipping, but stay with me it gets better. I plan to re-write and add more to the first 30 in the future, but if you can push through I feel it gets much more fun after!

18235,Outlook: The Stars (Consciousness Unbound Book 1),"The year is 2152. Rune Yahui is a nineteen-year-old failure, not having gained entrance to college or the military, with no significant prospects in life. Even worse, Rune is the poorest of the poor, hailing from the mega-slums of New Southern Chicago, the lowest pit of America. 
In a desperate last-ditch attempt to gain a future more lustrous than toiling the rest of his days away in abhorrent conditions in one of the near sweat-shop level factories that dot the megapolis, Rune signs up for the Virtual Citizen program, a program to cull the excessive world population by transferring just their brains into a video game. In a stroke of rare luck, Rune is admitted into the program and happily submits himself to the surgery and digitization process. Unfortunately for him, he wakes up several hundred years later than he expected... or does he?

**Author's Note**
This isn't a type of story typical to RRL. You may have noticed LitRPG in the tags, but it's a relatively minor element in the story until later. You may also notice Slice of Life is in the tags. This story is going to be slow and there won't be any power tripping until way later if at all. The focus will be on character development. That doesn't mean I won't still have action/excitement, however. I encourage you to give the story a try. Maybe it will be your thing, maybe it won't. Thanks for even taking the time to read this, and if you do give my fiction a try, I hope you enjoy it. If you don't, well, I hope you find something that you do enjoy. Happy reading!",158

Hello dear readers,
As the author of Dragon Road: How I Rise in My New Life, there was a time where I didn't have access to my drafts for DR, so I decided to make this little 'oneshot' or short story based on my next work.

Please let me know how you feel about it or if there are any pointers you'd like to give. If it gets popular, I might decide to make a full novel of it alongside DR, otherwise I'll work on it after I'm done with my current novel. Enjoy!

18297,The Forgotten One,"Hey there everbody. This will be my second upload to Roll 20. Unfortunately I wasn't able to continue my previous one due to life and what not but I'm now back and have a some what new idea I've been kicking around for years. We'll see if i head back to my other fiction due to having things calming down. And like always I'm open to constructive critisims. Any way on to the synopsis.
The world as we know it is gone. Torn from everyone due to two major things. First and foremost a biologica lweapon that no one wanted to take credit for after it was released and couldn't be stopped (a zombie virus of sorts) and the way that many nations thought to stop it from spreading was to destory everything they could ofcourse that didn't include them selves. So there the world was in a mexican standoff with hundreds of countries with hundreds of nuclear weapons just dareing one another to make the first move. Once again no one knew who started it but it didn't matter once it started the world was doomed.
In an attempt to save people some scientists began working on a way to cryogenically frezze people so they could surive the on coming armegedon. The problem was before they could begin testing it on humnas the nukes began launching. In a bid to save them selves a family gave their youngest son to the scientists as a test subject. He had already been infected by the virus weeks before the nukes were being threatened and still retained his humanitiy. After being betrayed by his family after telling them of his ability to stay him self and a few things the bio weapon had changed in him physically he was sedated with enough drugs to kill a whole pride of elephants and forced to take part in the experiment. The last thing he remembers was watching his world close around him (his cryo pod) and his family's face of sadness but also hope in the fact that them betraying him may give them a chance to live.
This is a fan fiction in which many aspects of one of my favorite games will be quiet prevelent. It will be obvious to those who have played it but for those who may not the game i'm going to be baseing some of the things in this novel is called Prototype. And no I do not own the rights to the cover. If the creater would like for me to pull it down please messege me.",102
18301,The Godly Protector,"The World of Aethion, is home to many wonders absent from the mundane world we live in. It is home to monsters and magic, but also so much more. Aethion, is a place of rich culture and beauty, both in its inhabitants and its scenery. Humans exist in Aethion, but they are not the only inhabitants. There exist the long lived and beautiful Elves, the industrious and trade minded Thangar, as well as other races of a more alien nature to us, such as the reclusive and enigmatic insectoid Nah’ni.
Despite the overwhelming beauty and exoticness, it is a harsh and dangerous place. Though the gods have Blessed the Races, some more than others, they are not selfless, in Aethion, the strong must struggle for their strength. This is not always the case, there are those who are Blessed by the Gods, these individuals are rare, but they are more talented and generally stronger than others, in certain ways. The other exception, are the Summoned, also called Heroes, they are brought into the world by the Gods, through the Races of Aethion.
The First Summoning was of a man from Earth, he was a Japanese born man, from the Warring States era. He was blessed by many Gods, and was astonishingly powerful in battle; he fought against the First Demon Lord. Demon Lords were the Titles given to Monsters that evolved to become near godlike in power. This Demon Lords name was Rahdon, well, that was the name he gave himself, he was an actual demon, but not all Demon Lords are Demons, there have been Ogre Demon Lords, and even Goblin Demon Lords.
After the man killed Rahdon, he founded a country, the Drakon Empire, the Land of Dragons. It took heavy influence from his experiences in Japan, and was a feudal nation. It has remained a great power over the years, and has helped the world as a whole. It is one of the reasons that when the Overflow came, the Countries, Nations, and Empires of Aethion performed a Summoning. That was nearly millennia ago, and a general peace has reigned between the countries.
In recent years, skirmishes have happened between several of the Countries, just as War was to begin, the Overflow struck once more. Though Dungeons and the monsters within are a potential source of strength for the people of Aethion, they are dangerous. The most dangerous aspect of them however, is the Overflow, a period of time, usually after a Demon Lord is killed, when monsters usually confined to Dungeons and Labyrinths burst forth.
Though there is once more a threat against the Races, they are still far from united. Many of the Countries have performed the Summoning to bring Heroes, both to fight the Overflow and as a defense against other countries. More than one Deity has created a Hero for their own goals, but not everything will go as planned.
This is a rewrite of a story I posted here before, that story was Fate of the Summoned.
Though this story will have harem and be a hero summoning story, I hope to not follow too many of the clichés, though a few might be present in some shape or form. That being said, appearances can be deceiving, so try not to take some of the characters at face value initially.There will be no concrete Schedule, especially as i have no internet connection at my place of residence.",11

Important Note: This is going to be an evolving story as I write. I am sure many of you will have plenty of criticisms for the earliest/earlier chapters and some of them are justified but I intend to continuously improve as I progress through the story. I hope you stick with me until then. 

Features: Technology Gap, Mechs in a Fantasy World, Conspiracies and Mysteries, Epic Adventures!
Note: Mechs will be featured but it is NOT the main thing about this story. There will be extended periods of time of a more grounded story rather than mech warfare. But worry not, there will also be times of full-on glorious mech battles so keep reading!

A narrow beam energy signal appeared aimed squarely at earth from the TRAPPIST system. The communication consisted of a layered set of repeating data over several thousand wavelengths. Over the next few months scientists discovered that the lower wavelengths carried an encoded numerical language which could then be used to interpret the more complicated messages carried on the higher wavelengths. After half a year of painstaking work the signal was fully decoded. It described a small satellite launched along a precise trajectory towards the fourth planet of our solar system. Included was a package of advanced research that humanity would need to have ready in order to receive the satellite and decelerate it safely. The alien data provided the kick that humanity needed to turn from petty squabbling and unite to explore the final frontier. Major government and corporate leaders worked together to create the framework for the United Federation of Sol. UFS spaceports went from scaffolding to daily launches in every major city around the globe. Ships floated like dandelion seeds, spreading on solar wind to grow into colonies.
2397 - Mars orbit, Egeria Station
The command center was a hive of activity as checks were conducted and systems initialized. Scientists flitted by like mayflies as communicators beeped and holoscreens spat out green tinted readouts. Nervous energy was thick in the air as everyone anticipated the culmination of over three hundred years of work. Massive fusion reactors under the planet's surface thrummed with barely restrained power as energy fed into a gleaming metallic maze criss crossing the planet. Metal fingers reached up, overshadowing the mighty olympus mons and trying to grab the stars. All over the solar system, people quickly turned to look as gigantic energy lances shot from the dusty fourth planet.
Two years later. The same people that clapped loudly at the successful activation of project Hermes now wait with baited breath. A silver capsule trailing bright photonic sails is captured by a net of grav beams and guided with care bordering on reverence into the station. Holoscreens across the headquarters project an image of the sleek craft settling in the bay. Data connections are established and the holoscreens blink to white. Slowly an image forms on the screen. Across the headquarters people stare in wonder as a wholly alien face stares back.

now if you want what I'd actually like to tell you: This is the author (me) talking to the reader (you). I'll start off by saying I am a reader too, I love that escape. But why are we escaping? It's because consciously or not we aren't satisfied with this reality. We hate being chained here. We read because we want to be free, we want to be strong, we want to be the best. We crave that chance to soar out of the mundane. We desire that power, pride and security in being the best, someone untouchable. At least I know I do. So although I can't give you what would truly satisfy that silent scream of defiant discontent, I wanna offer you a ride on this journey.

The inspiration for Book (brackets say roughly what I got inspiration from)
Do note: I do completely copy anything from any books. All of this book is original and all the books mentioned below are simply inspiration that gave me the ideas in regards to whats in the brackets. It may seem similar (like with MW I also use the E-E-D cultivation but my definitions and cultivation realms are different from the inspirations)
> Martial World (Cultivation Paths)
> Lord Xue Ying (Non-Generic Plot)
> Stellar Transformations (Unique Cultivation Technique)
> Consuming Earth, Devouring Skies (Character Development)
> Ancient Godly Monarch + Invincible (Martial Spirits + Own touch to this idea)
> The Storm King + Lament of the Fallen (The Soul Realm/Soul Domain)

Ok, I will just say that there are several reasons why the MC's cultivation speed is so mediocre despite how ""talented"" he is. There are logical reasons and they will be explained when necessary. Just remember that cultivation speed isn't everything.
Hope you enjoy. I will take constructive feedback and logical criticism. However, I will not even reply to illogical criticism, rants or salty people who got pissed off because the main character didn't get ""that divine medicine"" or ""this divine sword"" or whatever.

======================
OC-insert without knowledge of Game of Thrones, new planeswalker. Slow power ramp.
Second crossover: Star Wars (around chapter 39).
=======================
As a note, I started this as a speed writing challenge to myself.  The challenge was successful, and I managed 100,000+ words (as well as some character sheets in excel and such) over 10.5 days.  Then I had to stop and let my hands recover from their burgeoning carpal tunnel syndrome. The story currently stands at around 150,000 words (or ~550 RRL pages) over 54 chapters; expect a chapter a day until I've caught up with the backlog.
The focus of this story was not quality writing, and that hasn't changed.  I mostly use it as my semi-guilty ""I need to write something, but am not focused enough to write something good"" story.  Expect self-indulgent writing in general, and a bit of OP (or, well, more than just a bit if we're being honest), especially later in the story as the protagonist matures into a more full-blown Planeswalker.
But if you're looking for something with a power-ramping protagonist romping around the place, something you'd be a bit embarrassed to admit liking (I know I am) but like anyways (and come on, this is RRL, so that probably describes just about everyone here who actually has shame), then this may be a nice bit of mental junk food for you.","1,967"

(Worm/Fate/Badass of the Week)
Warning: crack-taken-seriously, over-the-top pulp-fiction style violence, overpowered protagonist, banned on two other sites.  Hell, even the light-hearted omake jokes in this were considered too subversive to persist.
============================
AN: There’s this really, really excellent website called Badass of the Week.  I’ve wasted many an hour browsing through, marveling at all the crazy shit some humans are capable of.  Check it out, then come back and read this in a few days when the awesome starts to wear off.  It’s worth it (all 576 entries).
Back?  Good!
Anyways, I was looking through it recently while thinking about who I wanted to make expy’s of for my The Flying Dutchman quest ship captains (which now languishes in indefinite hiatus), and I had this idea.  What if Taylor, wanting to be a badass, triggered with the power to be a different Badass every week?  With a bit of Fate-style ability to draw on the tools associated with the legend (but to a  just marginally less ridiculous degree), and a drive and aura to be and do badass?  
And thus, Badass was born in it’s somewhat cracky glory.

The brands of the ones that brought them to this miserable state are engraved in their skin and both their bodies and minds are damaged by the sorcerers.

This is sort of a reboot of Anomaly, the first novel I tried to write. I gave up Anomaly after going to college. I thought about going back to it, but... when I look at it now, it's not very good. It was very edgy and not much substance behind that edge. The story wasn't quite going anywhere since I hadn't given the main character a goal. I had planned out a story, but I forgot to to plan out the details between the beginning and end. So this one's for real. Hopefully you won't be disappointed.",7

18719,A generic love story: disturbance,"To escape the boring dogma that society presents, many choose to turn away and bathe in a fictional world with fantastic fantasies. There they are awed by the great heroes and villains; by great battles between powerful forces, and by things that the real world didn`t seem to hold. But by doing so, they cruely ignored the pains and suffering of actual human beings, as well as the real threat humans can pose to eachother under extreme but still very real conditions. What many failed to realise, is the fact that unspeakable evil is very much doable by a mere anybody, and with that, the terrifying things a human can do when their mind is twisted. This story is a pathetically poor, but still a desperate attempt to reveal the depths of human emotions and what they can drive us to do.
Following Sougo Kyoya, a boy with a tragic past and violent future, the story will deliver hard to understand martial arts and psychological behavior, masochism, and BDSM smut scenes.

Hi, name is Carl. As you can probably tell I can't write at all and this just a hobby. I will try to post but I do not have a lot of free time and the chapters will be kind of short as well.

18757,The Hollow,"""When life gives you lemons, you should be grateful that it is only lemons. It could have been AIDS."" - Hilda Caligari
Just because life throws you away as worthless does not mean death has the same ideas. The chance to be reborn and live a second life is tempting, assuming you don't get stabbed to death or worse. For a former sociopath experiencing emotions might seem troubling, until the realisation sets in that they are now alone and stranded in a new world in a female body. Of course, alone discounts the distinctly demonic, succubus looking spirit stitched to their soul, who has an uncomfortable love of sharp objects, knives and stabbing things. All of the things.

18763,The Fabled Islands,"Somewhere out there, in the great expanse of space and time, exist the Fabled Islands. Nobody knows how or why they exist, but only that it is a strange and special place that operates under laws separate from the universe.
 
The Fabled Islands are made up of vast floating continents. They vary in size, with some ranging from the surface area of a small planet, to a star. If you look at them from afar, you would find that they are placed in a line. Each island is separated by a vast amount of space, so there is only one way to travel from one island to the next; a gateway on the edge of the island.
 
Each island is governed by strange rules. The only thing they share in common, is that the rules are governed by the System. The rules change vastly from one island to the next, so you must quickly adapt.
 
Tristan was raised on the first island, Fertility Island, and has finally been allowed to become a Brave; a respected profession throughout the islands. Fertility Island is a peaceful island. There are hardly any monsters, the land is fertile, and the people kind. 
 
This is the complete opposite of what Tristan wants.
 
Bring on the monsters! Bring on the magical items! I want adventure, loot, and to put my life on the line! Where are the dungeons, caverns, and mountains to be explored? Where is the mythical equipment to be found? The next island? Then the next island I will go!
 
His adventure begins now.",685
18764,... And My Skillet,"A long time ago, a child was born under the great blue sky. Many a Dwarf grumbled at the auspicious event, tugging furtively at their beards at this ill omen. A year later as the expedition had begun digging into the virgin hills of their new home, the grumbling of the doughty mountain people rose to a disbelieving furor when the yearling passed over the ritual offerings that would determine his lot in life. Instead, the as of yet unnamed child crawled over to a skillet fresh out of the fire and begun picking at the rock bread, unconcerned with the heat.
Shouts turned into laughter, frowns lifted into craggy smiles. Upon placing a handful of the bread into his mouth, the infant’s face grew so grim and stony not even the eldest of the present Dwarves could match him. There was a durable ore within this babe, of that the Lore Keeper was sure.
Yumly Ironhand was thus named, the beginning of his great tale immortalized on the rune walls of his clan’s history.

18770,Lemme Smash!,"Among us, maybe even someone you know, there is a protagonist. Sometimes, however, there isn't only one. This journey is just the perspective of a few of the many. Depending on opinions, it might be a single perspective.
For this, we find our MC. Your average Earth Otaku. A man that lusts for his sister. A man that has folders full of tentacle porn. A man that leaves tissues covered in his essence scattered around his room. You would describe such a person as despicable, would you not?
In the viewpoint of our MC, his life living as garbage ends today. He will leave this life forever. Fortunately - or rather, unfortunately - for him, it is more literal than anyone could imagine.
Get ready to start anew in a fantasy world. A fresh beginning saturated with action, adventure, and everything shounen. Reincarnation as a hammer, one of the things they can't do, also being one of the only things they can do. That is, to smash. Oh, the irony.

Amy Barnes, an aspiring chemical researcher, finds herself dying from cancer. One of her most desperate prayers is answered in a way that she'd never dreamed possible, and she finds herself living a new life as a dungeon. Warning: Violence, morbidity
Cover: Taken from here, courtesy of www.pexels.com by photographer @tookapic.
Author's Note:
I've read some dungeon core stories on here, and they've tickled my fancy. I've thought up a whole story, start to finish, and thought it'd be a blast to put it into words.
Other than the violent and morbid aspects, this story is suitable for children. Aside from the vocabulary, that is. I will avoid the temptation to have any cursing, sexuality, or gore. Excessive gore, I suppose - it is a dungeon story, after all.
I’ll do a little research from time to time, but this story will not have a great deal of rigor. I’ve made Amy’s knowledge comparable to my own for that reason. There’s a few things she knows more about than I do, and a few things that she knows less about. Unlike me, she doesn’t have access to Google - it’s a non issue for her to be more knowledgeable than me, on occasion :P
This story does not use the same magic system that I’ve used in either Sorcery in Boston or A Summoner’s Confession. This one is mostly intention based, and designed to be easier access for people who are more used to the idea of, “It’s magic, therefore it works” kind of thinking. Do note that Amy is, in most senses of the term, overpowered. This goes along with the usual dungeon core stories. She’s not more powerful than other dungeons per se, but she does have knowledge and intelligence that puts them to shame.
I thought about doing this in a LitRPG style, but systems take balance, and I wanted this to be pure fun to write.This story was inspired from a few sources. Despite the title, it wasn’t really inspired by Of Mice and Men, though some of the themes match. Rather, I’ve taken inspiration from a few dungeon core novels on Royal Road Legends for the main idea. Many conventions of dungeon core stories have been perverted from the genre, however.
I’ve taken my usual science-loving self to town to play around with the powers, and I can only hope you have half as much fun reading this as I have had writing it.",140
18815,Puppy Love,"World-class and cold-blooded assassin Zeth Eins goes into hiding after successfully killing off one of the largest kingpins in the world. Needing to lay low for a while and with advice from a trusted parter, goes somewhere far. He ends up being hired as a house-helper for a 'single mother' and her daughter who goes to the local highschool. Zeth's partner insists he takes the job to embed himself as a part of a household and avoid anything that would warrant too much attention. Inch by inch, he slowly discovers an emotion that might tear apart his career.",0
18816,Sentinel : Book 2.5,Book two. the Continuation of broken. This is a kinda filler but still has content I consider realavant but it's not super important. I'll also be posting what is meame to be book two but will just be called book three soon. This book is just kinda more intro and story background on how things end up later. But yeah expect me just bleasting chapers at random or almost always Friday and sorry for the big wait my Bros computer died so I couldn't update but yeah back at it again.,0

18818,Transmigrator: Not really a PLAYER,"The second personality played a cruel joke with the main character, but he did not despair.

In his new life, the main character will meet new friends to begin his journey, overcoming all difficulties. Follow him and see how he will conquer this world with his own hands.",41
18822,The Destiny Detour,"In a kingdom putting together the pieces after a series of devastating magical wars, trouble is brewing. At least that's what the Seer's vague warning to Princess Lillya claims.

Join XENOS on his journey, as he unravels the truth behind the DAWN OF GENESIS, who he truly is and what is the meaning behind his existence.

Fair Warning: This fiction contains many of the well-known light novel tropes, though I try to give them my own spin. If you’re tired of them by now, you might want to keep away. There are no demon lords however, nor any end-of-the-world cataclysm situation that only the MC can solve.

This is a story principally centered on the trials of a young man and his people as they fight for freedom against their oppressors. 
I understand this synopsis is vague so I implore you to read the first chapter and see if you like it. The story will develop as I write it and while I have some ideas as to its general structure, there is nothing concrete so that is the reason for the vagueness.

For Milton, things changed for the better. The world became familiar. He could find loot, learn skills, and equip weapons and armor. It was all much easier to understand than the perils of pre-Apocalypse life with its grocery shopping and going outside.
Then he discovers Ragnarok, Orchestrator of the Rainbow Letters and all of Milton’s problems. The race to figure out why is on. If Milton is to survive long enough to find answers, he must first be strong enough to confront his worst enemy: himself.

18947,The Archaic System - A New Beginning,"***[Setting]***By the early 26th Century humanity had exhausted all resources that could sustain human life. Fortunately, in a science experiment in 2008 something unexpected occurred ripping open a portal to a completely different universe. Humanity spent the next 500 years preparing for their migration to the planet of Agartha.
Humanity, couldn't bring any of their advanced technology. However, they managed to create a system that allowed humans to develop themselves and gain abilities similar to the native sentient species of Agartha. To humans this system appeared and functioned almost like a video game.
***[Plot]***After living on Agartha for ten years our MC dies under the blade of the person he was desperately trying to find and protect, his brother. However, through some twist of fate he wakes up alive and back on Earth, returned to the day he migrated to Agartha. A time before he suffered through unspeakable hardships and adversity. A time before he witnessed the cruelty of humanity. A time before he was used and tossed away by others.
Our MC decides that he cannot allow the injustices of his past life to repeat themselves. That he will use what he has learned over his ten years of struggle to become someone who cannot be ignored, cannot be trampled, someone with real strength.
Follow our MC as he struggles to overcome his weakness, face the enemies of his past, uncover the truth about his brother, and confronts situations that make him question his humanity.
***[Author's Note]***The system in this novel is not unique to our MC, all humans have it. The system does not make the MC overpowered. What does make our MC unique is that he uses his intelligence, knowledge of Agartha/future, and ability to understand how people think to manipulate and plot against his enemies. While they become weaker, he grows stronger.
I have intentionally made great efforts to make the novel as realistic as possible. While it is a fictional world everything works how we would expect it to. This includes how characters react. My characters respond in ways that would make sense for an actual person in their situation. None of my characters will act arrogantly for no reason or relentlessly pursue the MC to get revenge for a small issue. I do my best to create a world my readers can immerse themselves in, which is made possible by being as realistic as I can.",335

18949,Slave 53: The Phoenix,"Azgarth is a violent Warlord from a planet where everyone feared him, a man that never lost a battle whether it be from his enemies surrendering or dying.  After entering a wormhole, this once infamous man had his memory completely wiped.  He was enslaved under the name 53.
The great comet arrived one day and gave 53 an extremely rare animal aspect, the Phoenix.  Having a rare animal aspect puts people on the fast track to power in this world.  Will 53 show the same brutality as his former self?
 
Author: So there will probably be a lot of changes when I start hashing out the whole classes and what not.  I'm not planning on this to have statuses or anything like that, but when people 'lvl up' is probably going to be something like ascending 1, 2, 3, etc.  With each ascension they are many times stronger, for example, someone who hasn't ascend at all would be at 0, but someone with a 1 would be about 5x stronger than someone who is 0 and so on.  It would take a long time to reach each one. 
With the red colored marks which represents fire, I have a couple ideas with what I want to do, in a way a battle royale, as this continent they are on isn't very large, but all four elements are on it (or more, I might add light, dark, and some others) but all the humans have red, while a different alien race has blue (water), brown (earth), and grey (Air).  The color of the mark they have influences how they feel about each other, a example of that would be if a red saw a brown, then they would naturally feel a disgust about each other, and if they killed someone from a different color they would gain way more life essence which is needed to ascend than they would killing someone from their same color.
The last thing, I'm not too sure about the main character yet, as I like the whole idea of a memory wipe, I almost think it'd be more entertaining to have the guy slowly regain all his memory, then just becoming his normal self again.  If that's the case I'll have to change the title of book.  The original idea was this guy would keep the name 53, and his prior self named Azgarth is sharing his body, as in he can talk to him and give him advice on things since he doesn't want him to die since he is sorta like a split personality sharing the same body.  Looking at it now, idk if I want this guy to be named 53 forever.
Warning: A lot of dark content in the book, especially in the flashbacks.",16

then, while he was torturing yet another unfortunate soul, he had been contacted by a fellow god, a senior one. that god had entrusted Loki with a strange soul, with an order of accomodating him in his world, protecting him, and giving him the right to enjoy life in his world.
Loki, however, didn't even thought about obeying his senior god's orders; ""humph, who does he think he is, ordering me around like that? me, babysitting some mortal..?! well, I started getting bored from this toy anyway, hahaha..! le's see what kind of misery souls from other worlds can show, shall we?""
and he toyed with his newly ""gifted toy"", and got absorbed in it. he got so joyful, that human soul had given him such misery and despair, that can't even be compared to his own world's souls! he ended up reincarnating said soul over 50 times, while the most he had ever done was 26 times.
but that was a mistake. he should've listened and obeyed the senior god's warnings.
that human soul... was broken from the start. it was not just a normal human, mortal soul... it had been something that was more terrifying than gods.
it was something which may have been left dormant for eternity, if not for Loki's foolishness.....

18990,Reflections: Memoirs of a Minder Book 1,"Hello everyone and welcome,
My name is Brett Tierney and you have just entered the Minder universe. A creation of mine inspired by the events throughout history greatly studied by the UFO community and conspiracy theorists alike. I have been fascinated by the idea of extraterrestrials and aliens. The thought of not being alone is comforting to me. Throughout the years i have tried to study and take in as much information as I could. From all angles, viewpoints, and beliefs. I have become extremely accepting of all ideas and possibilities. However, in late 2017 I heard the interview of a man named Dan Burisch. A microbiologist that used to work at Area 51, S4 division, who had an up close personal encounter with a Grey alien. During his 3 hour interview, he talked about a wide range of topics revolving the UFO phenomenon. However, it was the part about time, and the possibility that extra terrestrials could be humans from the future that inspired me to create this story. It is a story of great mystery, excitement, conflict, and discovery.
Here is a link to his interview.
This is a universe set in many times. However the primary setting is roughly 54,000 years into the future. Long after an event nearly eradicates man kind and they are forced to fight for their survival across the galaxy. Giving man enough time to evolve and develop major physiological and psychological changes. New civilizations have formed and the majority of human kind is still trying to return home to the beauty of Earth. While others, fight to keep things the way they are. They begin to travel through time to alter the course of history.
I started this as a blog series of my own creation before I heard about Royal Road Legends. The story follows the lives of six individuals as they unravel the mystery of the human race. I will be writing their stories in the form of a weekly series. A new chapter out every week.
I hope you enjoy the series and thanks for taking the time to check me out.",1
18991,Titan Warriors - A Mech LitRPg,"Sergeant Brandon Mc’Dew was an Airborne Ranger and a good one too. That is until he found that one mission that ended his career like so many other warriors before him.
But instead of pearly gates or red flames Brandon awoke in a white room full of ugly green chairs and an image of his brain floating in a tube.
The life he knew was a simulation to train rapid grown people. The universe he now finds himself in is a war torn far future where Humanity as dominated the stars. Enlisted against his better opinions he finds himself a fledgling Titan Jock in a minor noble House on a far off arm of the Milky Way.
Brandon is stuck trying to survive in this new world. A world where 100 meter tall robots of war dominate the battlefield, Kings and Queens rule from thrones upon high, uncaring of the people beneath them, and expendable people can be grown in a tube to fight a war they know nothing about.
