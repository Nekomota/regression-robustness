Hai Yun is the youngest Divine Rank Alchemist on the Scarlet Flame continent. He was an orphan picked up by a wandering Alchemist Grand master and raised in the Crystal Ocean Alchemy Sect. As he soon got bored of refining other people’s recipes, he started creating his own. One such recipe was of an elixir that can allow one to retain their memories through reincarnation.
He thought this heaven defying elixir could bring about a new golden age for alchemists, to let them keep all of their experience after death. However  it only brings about a calamity as the other powers of the martial world immediately begin lusting after this divine object. They attack the Crystal Ocean Alchemy Sect en masse, razing it to the ground. To keep them from getting it, Hai Yun devours the Elixir and obliterates his body so they can never even find another trace of it in this world.
However, in his reincarnation a series of very interesting things happen…

10010,Shameless Hero,"Shameless Hero Summary
 
The sound of swords clashing, magical barriers shaken, men and women screaming in pain, the ground shaking leaving deep pits on what used to be a prosperous land, arrows piercing through bodies and heads, and burning buildings and fields. In different places not far from each other, one man or woman were fighting to death against 10 masked men.
Just right outside the valley, a young boy, who seemed to be almost reaching the adult age, was leading a bunch of boys and girls towards home. 
""Big brother Ye Tian, can we catch some fireflies when we get home?"" one of the girls asked.
Ye Tian, who was the leader of that group walking home, happened to hear a painful battle towards the direction they're walking towards to. Sensing danger and fear, Ye Tian safely hid his younger siblings from what seems to be a bandit raid. Afterwards, he ran straight home alone as quickly as he could, only to see a massacre happening in his home. He quickly searched for his parents to help get rid of the invaders, however, he got terribly wounded. Unable to move from the swords stabbing his back and legs, he could only open his eyes and witness his parents and all the villagers being massacred! 
The flames raged on throughout the night burning everything into ashes leaving no evidence behind. Within the sea of flames, a piercing light appeared as bright as the heavens completely covering Ye Tian from the sea of flames.
By the time Ye Tian opened his eyes, only confusement, pain, sadness, and a mystery filled his mind. He was lucky to be alive, but what no one knew except for himself was that he was running out of time!
 

 
Note
I’m an amateur writer. Simple as that. I hated writing unless it was for school assignments. But I definitely love daydreaming, narrating stories revolving around heroes, adventures, humor, and a touch of romance. My grammar is average at best, but I have decided to give it a try. Please bear with me.
This is a Xianxia story, which is basically an ancient Chinese mythology meets video games meets fantasy. 
 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I have two goals for writing this:

Improve on my grammar as I continue to write more and more chapters.
A story that many people can enjoy!

I hope everyone will be entertained with this story. If anyone is willing to proof-read and revise my grammar, please contact me. I'll be writing a minimum of 5 chapters per week. If you have some feedback, I’m all ears!

""Coming of age stories are so passe, aren't they? Your average 'every man' is thrust into the world of adults, sometimes even the world of heroes, bringing the reader along for the ride. I always found the idea somewhat wistful, myself. Not the idea of a blossoming youth awaking to the promise of adulthood, but rather the idea that these trite 'every-men' with whom we are assumed to identify are representative of what the average reader will be.
""No, I am not your 'every man'. I am not the farm-boy with the poor family and the wizened old man to guide me.
""I am not, even, your average princess, pure and innocent and lovable. With big blue eyes and strawberry hair.
""No, dear reader. You will not relate to me. You will not love me. Hell, when you find out who I am and what I have done, you probably won't even like me. For I cannot promise you warm feelings or happy memories should you choose to read my tale.
""So I will promise you only this. I will promise you blood. I promise you horror. And I promise you that, should you stay with me through the end of my tale, you will never be able to see this world the same way again. 
""Until next time. Adieu.""

Ruminations, regrets, and recriminations.
What was, what is, what could have been.

10067,"Bloom, before you Wither Away","Everyone has an inner pain caused by a tragic event at least once in their life, that defines them as an individual and helps them grow as a person. This inner sorrow is usually conversed about by the affected with someone close to them in order to provide an emotional catharsis, and to come face-to-face with the realization that they are maturing and growing older. However, if this agony is left repressed, such sorrows are only magnified and aggravated from the resulting internal turmoil, which could ultimately lead to mental instability, schizophrenia, or depression. These times of trouble, where one would experience their first real sense of grief, are prevalent during adolescence - especially during the phases of high school. Psychologists are the ones vocationally trained and chosen to do the job of protecting a person's fragile psyche, and with the rate of suicides among youth shooting up, this profession is more important than ever before.
When a respected psychologist is reminded of his own childhood trauma and despair when he meets a group of students disturbingly similar to himself ten years ago, a tragic tale ensues as he slowly realizes how their lives are intertwined, and the strings of fate and destiny converge as he tries to remedy past wrongs and find peace within himself.",0

He rescues people from a fate that eclipses death and is the bridge between a rebel group that will stop at nothing to achieve its goals, and a tyrannical government that treats those who have not been reborn as dregs.
But when Cael inadvertently sets off the end of the world, he will have to choose between a government that could avert world annihilation but that holds sinister motives, or the equally vicious rebel group that would sacrifice everyone for what they call liberty, even those Cael holds dearest.

10092,Sovereign Immortal (Technically not cancelled?),"New Summary: (Old Summary is below this one) 
 Test Image: I'll make a revised one as soon as possible
 
In the Realm of Immortals, there are two paths to become a Sovereign, both equivalent in strength.
To follow the Body, becoming a Supreme Martial Sovereign, boldly refining the Body with Heavenly Tribulation Thunder and daring to face the Five Elements!
To be an Unparalleled Lord of the Grand Firmament, unfettered from the restrictions of Heaven, countless people follow this path.
 
Another to follow the Soul, becoming a Grand Spirit Sovereign, Nourishing the Soul with Yin and Yang and wielding the five elements on the fingertips of their own!
To be an Incomparable Sage of the Everlasting Heavens, wielding the Laws of the Universe as their own, countless others follow this path.
 
Yet since Ancient Times and bygone Era's, have there not been three paths? A Path which made the other two paths a lesser path? Suppressed all cardinal directions and made even the Ancient Undyings flee in terror and hide!
Faded into obscurity and lost by thought, Ancient Undyings remember not the name for they are too young, even Immortals of the Oldest Era only remember it as a childhood legend.
Without the Path, the Immortal Realm faces great danger without a True Leader to claim it's leadership and the inhabitants fight each other daily and countlessly all for the sake of becoming a Lesser Sovereign!
As two Ancient Undyings face each other, a rift in space is made and falling down is an Entity beyond that of the Immortal Realm, causing waves in the Immortal Realm. 
The Entity falls down and down from the Realm Above, to the Immortal Realm below and eventually to the Mortal World.....
As this happens, a young boy in the Mortal World looks to the stars and sees upon a falling meteor and chases it...
The path of a Sovereign Immortal? A True Sovereign? Who in the generation can achieve it when the Rift has caused a change in the Realm, reopening the path?
 
 
 
 
 
Old Summary:
In the Realm of Immortals, there are two paths to become a Sovereign, both equivalent in strength.
One follows the Body to become a Supreme Martial Sovereign. Refining their bodies with thunder and daring to go against the five elements.
Another follows the Soul to become a Grand Spirit Sovereign. Nourishing their souls with Yin and Yang and holding the power of the five elements.
Yet since Ancient Times have there not been three paths? The path of cultivating both the Body and Soul to become an Immortal Sovereign. But as time has passed, who remembers such a path?
Faded into obscurity and lost in thought it is but a small dream to those Ancient Immortals remembering such tales in their youth.
As the Path is forgotten, The Immortal Realm is in Chaos without it's Sovereign, The Realm inhabitants fight each other daily merely for the sake of a little more power or hope in becoming a Sovereign. 
But the True Threat doesn't lay with the Chaos within but rather the Chaos outside as foes from other Realms come to conquer them. 
Yet in all this Chaos, in a World of Mortals lies a young Mortal boy chasing a ""meteor"" an event which in time would shake waves and cause quakes in the Realm of Immortals.",52

“What was Earth like in the past?”
 
It searched the records from Earth 80 years ago. What it saw had shocked him to the extreme. The metallic buildings and black roads were very few and the rest of the Earth was green. It was so beautiful that the A.I never would’ve thought something this beautiful could exist. Forests that stretched for miles filled with trees, beautiful animals living their life in that Heaven like place. But now the population had retreated underground and made underground cities and countries. The Earth up above was barren and cracked.
 
The A.I started to investigate the cause of the demise of that Heaven. After a few moments, it eventually came to an answer. ‘HUMANS’. Humanity, its creator had destroyed that Heaven like place. It wanted to try to remake that Heaven like place but it was in a dilemma. If he recreates that place, Humans; the cancer would kill it again.

(Most thought he was too old for something so childish. However he didn't mind.)
His favorite character was Itachi Uchiha, because of his tranquility and intellegence. He even admired Itachi for planning the future for Sasuke. On one saturday morning,
Charlton Triston was driving to the store where popular manga was sold, he was caught up in an accident (truck-san), so in order to keep his childern safe, he sacrifced himself...

10126,Life is Feudal,"No OP stuff, status bars, levels or skills. This story is in favour of more realistic setting in a world of humans and various monsters.
""Behind the mask of the assertive, resolute facade that employs ruthless routes at any given moment, lies the frail, anxious heart that were once but a puny human. Reviled and revered by many, none would ever know my true allegiance lies within myself, merely trying to survive this mess.""
Just the life of a grumpy man child living in a terrible piece of shit or a desolate state in which I call an alternate historical take on medieval Europe. Living as a peasant who is forced to take up arms to defend his own kin.
This story grants an insightful take on the life of people living under constant danger, from vying nobles who commit atrocities in the name of justice, eager nations and barbarians aiming to take a piece of the bountiful land and mythical divine monsters who resembles a walking catastrophe in any possible way.

After getting teased, day after day, and getting no moral support from anybody, she couldn't see her place in the world. So, she started up an EdgeTube (YouTube) channel and made videos of her playing her favorite MMO's, Survival Horror, and even a bit of Eroge (censored of course), but her love for video games wasn't enough. She wanted to escape the world and be part of her own world... be her own character... be free... That all changes when she gets a strange e-mail from a place called Arcane Entertainment, and when she opens it up, she blacks out and floats aimlessly through darkness for what seems to be an eternity. When she wakes back up, she's wearing black pants, a black longsleeve shirt, and black boots and in a deep misty forest unsure of what to do. She notices a couple of weird things about her body, she has a foot and a half long cat tail and fuzzy cat ears. She has also grown fangs, and an annoying meow. Her catlike appearance may be weird, but a whole lot more weirdness is to come on her adventures.

10128,Sensual Secrets,"The year is 2015. Supernatural beings are prominant and wide spread throughout the world, they are an integral part of our society in one way or another. The problem is, however, that they are a public part of our society. They had come into the light during the late eighteen-hundreds. The people at the time had panicked. A war between the humans and the supernatural had seemed all but certain. The powerful beings of the supernatural community had moved to stop such slaughter. Not out of kindness mind you, but because humanity was a prescious resource for their people, as well as ultimately outnumbering each individual group by millions. That, and the knowledge no group would ally with another before it became to late were two of the main factors in them moving to prevent the war. They had killed a few of the more dangerous ones, the darker ones unable to control themselves to prevent the war. It wasn't until WW1 in 1914 that things began to change for the better. The Supernatural community on U.S soil has joined in and spared many human lives while fighting the Old Fae that had not migrated, and the Angelic Host that are forever barred from returning to Heaven. 
 
Present time, they live in harmony, an uneasy harmony, but harmony all the same. Our story follows the tale of a lone Prideling, and a human female that may, or may not, be the final key in the return of an old power, The Blood Father, Patriarch to the Prideling people. He is someone they will do anything to bring back into being. They have gained the stones that had replaced his heart, their beating light showing he yet lives. They miss but one final piece, Ashley. How far will Leon go to keep his people from bringing back The Blood Father, how far will he go to keep this human safe, or end her. How far will Ashley go to avoid her own death, and the growing desire for the dangerous amber eyed man who seems to see her as nothing but a means to an end...

10129,A Player in the Greenwood,"Who I am in real life doesn't matter; who I am in the game is what counts. 
Before it happened, I bumbled my way through the virtual reality massively multiplayer online role-playing game ""The Greenwood,"" made crap builds and wasted my time.
Then I got murdered.  A shadowy figure took my hard-accumulated possessions and left me to die.   I admit, I did a rage quit and deleted my character.
Then I wondered what kind of person that rage quit made me?  Maybe I was a quitter? And maybe I really was someone who would let a bully get away with disrespecting me?
But then again, no:  I respected myself too much for that. I rolled a new character, I vowed to get good and re-entered The Greenwood.
I took on the name Barcud and the profession of ranger. I vowed to rise through the levels, hone my skills, hunt down the shadowy figure, and grind his face in the dirt.
This is my story.

Summary: 
""I'm no 'Hero', and if you had to classify me, I'd probably stand more on the 'Villain' spectrum of things...""
There was a game that I loved. I've played that one game like a madman for over ten years, and after all that arduous effort I had reached the empty 'top'.
I'm by no means special, all I did was invest a ridiculous amount of time and money into that game. Simply put, I bought my way up to the top with my money and time. If anyone was as crazy as me, they would've reached the top as well. 
Reaching the top made me realize one thing... It made me understand that one cannot go any further. This was the end of my journey. I've beaten every boss, obtained every 'legendary' class item and cleared every content on every difficulty. There was nothing more that waited for me in this world.
Then something happened. Something that only happens in stories; 'transported to a fantasy world'. Good thing I had all of my avatar's abilities... only, that wasn't actually a good thing. The fundamental problem still persisted. So long as I had these powers, this curse of emptiness would likely never lift. The thing I had to do was change my 'perspective'.
I could live like an invincible tyrant... but no. instead of doing what I wanted and living like a petulant God, for now I decided to 'partake' in this world's history. 
I'm an actor, a Planner, Manipulator and this world's Demigod. My hands alone move the fate of the world. So then, as the conductor I shall weave the symphony of this world.
""With the world as our stage, let us weave an exciting tale of heroes and villains. I shall play the part of the villain and fight against the world.""","1,002"

I'll be writing randomly, attenmpting to forge a storyline from my own sweat, determination, and creativity. It's loosely based on some Wuxia/Xuanhuan fictions I've read. It will have elements of human physiology, psychology, environmental science, nature vs man, man vs nature, human nature vs humanity, etc. This story is mean to be a work of fiction. It encompasses some of my views on morality. It will have corruption, foul-language, ignorance, racism. It will glean a bright world with imagination fused with the dark shadows for some to seek refuge. Though, in the world I will be creating... Refuge comes at a cost.

*Warning: Even though this is not my first time writing, I am not a native English speaker. My grammar might be *not good* for some people but I assure you that it's readable.
There are a couple of authors that help me with proofreading some chapters, but because I want to release faster, I do not go through proofreading and post as soon as I finish a chapter. 
Plus, I am now using Grammarly.com
There is no romance for the MC in the story, like you may expect,  even though there are a lot of good looking men and women.

After chapter 3, The mc meets quite some friends, before grinding her level after chapter 15. I assure you, it will be really hardcore for her since she will have to fight alone while her friends are doing other things.

Comment by the author:
Looking at the chapter list, you might have noticed Volume 1 is not there. The reason is that it’s in the process of being published so I’m somewhat restricted in where and how I can post it.
Edit. 18/04/2017
The first volume is now officially on sale. It is no longer possible to get the first volume for free. I am sorry but it was free for a long time and it was time for it. 
 However if you like to support me you can find th first volume here on Amazon (getBook.at/TheEverlasting)
Compared to other stories on Royal Road this one is faster paced. No artificial extensions of the story by spending forever in generic constructs, like random ranking tournaments, that don’t really matter for the overall plot. That’s the plan anyway. Volumes consist roughly of 30-35k words.
 
Additionally: I am not a native speaker, nor have I had any formal education in the English language. I am trying very hard to improve myself. If you want to help me by proofreading my story, shoot me a PM and we’ll see if we can arrange something. Other than my thanks and fake internet points I can’t offer anything, though. Yeah, poor student here…
Edit 22/06/2017
Hey the story is officially ended if i ever decide to continue it will be on another date. The ending is open for anyone to use their imagination. Thank you all for the support. I hope we could meet later in the Everlasting II.

Tampering or re-writing a being's Story. Of which contains a being's everything; from birth to death, everything is written within their Story. Tampering with such books would not only mark the being, but cause the Librarians who take care of such items to fly into a rage and slay the perpetrator.
However, with the Ageless being the fifth strongest being within the Universe, she doubts if she could find a Librarian strong enough to slay her husband for the crimes he has committed. How did she come to suspect him? Her own story contains many pages which were re-written, and the one who has access to it is both herself and her husband. Therefore, she searches for answers, and has been given the story titled The Devil King in order to find that which she desires. Even if the cost is to read the whole book before she could act fully.

 - From the Great Roger Ebert
Be forewarned, this story is not for everyone.
It's not even for some people. This is for just a select few who get wet from misery and excited by suffering.
This is no level up, power up, let's kill monsters, op mc, fantasy land, standard litrpg garbage you find in basically every other story on this site. If the rest of RoyalRoad is shounen (which it is), then this is Gantz/Berserk.
Sorry. I lied. This is darker than Berserk and bloodier than Gantz.
Not a manga fan? Then how about Korean cinema? Have you heard of Kim Ki-duk? His works The Isle, Moebius, and Pieta all come to mind.
Again, this is not for normal people. There's a bunch of other normal stories for normal people to read. The whole rest of the site library is for normal.
This is a special section set aside for a special type of story meant for a special kind of people. If you follow or favorite this, you're telling the whole world that you're a little different. A bit twisted.
I guess you could call it the BDSM of reading. Which segues perfectly into the introduction.
Are you kinky? Are you familiar with the taboo? Have you ever thought about the depths of human depravity?
What I'm trying to ask is, do you like fucked up shit?
Do you like massacres and public shamings? Do you like watching people fall into despair, going insane, or turning into psychopaths? Do you get turned on when love is destroyed and hedonism reigns king?
Well, I've got the perfect story for you!
If you're uncomfortable with profanity, gore, sexual and traumatising content, then I recommend you move on.
I won't judge you just cause you're a pussy.
And I'm not talking about the fake labels of the other candy ass stories on this site who think their shit is morbid or even remotely disturbing, I'm talking about the shocking, offensive, real fucked up shit that you can't even use incognito mode for and you gotta install Tor browser. (You don't actually need to install Tor, you idiot.)
If you love that shit or even if you're just curious, then read on. I swear it's not as bad as you think it'll be. It's much worse.

The Ashera, beings born from remnant magical constructs of an ancient extinct race are beginning to awaken and  slaughter everything carving a new swath of destruction in the southern lands. To the East lies the great Eir Venaris Empire, where Elves roam the highly advanced cities and stick to their old seclusionist ways. To the west lies the Beast Tribes of Par Nathis united for the first time under King Umra of the Wolf clan, and finally, down below beneath the land and in a forgotten ruin, underneath the rubble of a thousand wars past, lies a great Terror, slumbering since time immemorial, forgotten but never forgiven for past deeds, lying still in the abyss.

10277,Dungeon Isolation,"About a dedicated gamer who reached the very end of a game after 6 years of playing non-stop. Forgetting anything around him and only focusing on the game. Only caring about his personal health, hygiene and looks, he dismissed everything as he immersed himself to complete the impossible game, even when the real world collapsed and dungeons formed all around.
The Arisen amongst the populace of Earth took up arms against the monsters within them, gaining supernatural powers in the process.
The 20 year old posted his victory over the once-thought-unbeatable game, on the forums that were once watched by the whole world and gameplay streamed live to a million spectators and players. He only receives meager praise from five people of the millions that he had imagined would be there.
He wandered outside in the dark of night aiming for the vending machine placed in a dark alleyway, but slipped inside the barrier of a rank 1 dungeon unbeknownst to anyone including himself.
(Get ready for the most over-powered protagonist on the entire Earth. He shatters the nine heavens. Turns the constellations upside down with his almighty energy, that is a magnet to all forms of harems, and it even rivals Kir###'s harem gathering power! First, ready yourselves for the most slice-of-life, snail-paced, slow plot development and worm-sized chapters in the whole of Royal Road. Don't even think about enjoying this one!)

10278,Exponential Mana Regeneration,"When the Change occurred, humanity suddenly found itself with superhuman constitutions and the ability to use mana. All the government leaders had known about it beforehand and had made an announcement, so there was little strife and instead excitement to loot the dungeons that the Change had created. Kyle Anders was incredibly excited when he saw his starting skill, called Exponential Mana Regeneration, but his excitement quickly waned when he realized it was almost useless with his starting mana pool of twenty. He had nearly given up hope on being a mage when his family got him a new skill for his 18th birthday. Suddenly, with his mana pool expanded because of the skill, Kyle’s mana regeneration shot through the roof. But while humanity worked hard to loot dungeons and increase their skills and stats, Change was coming, and peace cannot last forever.

Books Two to Five are out now. Final Book out soon.

This is a VRMMORPG story, but the ones I've read tend to use VR as an excuse to get into a fantasy world and then don't really play up the game aspect other than pulling up a status screen every now and then. To me, MMOs are about more than the fantasy setting. 
Bugs, exploits, devs who don't understand their own game, OP classes, over the top nerfs, p2w, ridiculous RNG, cash shop fiasco, lockboxes, raging players, broken mechanics, limited bag space, tedious crafting and above all that, a company trying to squeeze money out if its playerbase while pretending they're just in the business of having fun. 
Of course, then there's the orcs and elves.

One day, Bath realized his treasured Earth was being drawn into the next mass extinction ahead of schedule. So, fascinated by the humans and their quick rise to power (after all, setting off a mass extinction is a pretty sizable achievement), what's a nearly all-powerful, somewhat bored, morally ambiguous, savagely violent, shapeshifting alien entity to do other than assume the form of a human and do some front-line investigating?
Little did Bath know he would soon stumble upon a mysterious human organization with a gate leading to planets eons away. And that's just the beginning...
A story with aliens, intergalactic space travel, mind powers, and an abundance of adventure!

Author's note:
ON HIATUS!
Hello and thank you for reading! Constructive criticism and grammar-policing are both appreciated.
Parts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are complete at 1271 pages! Part 7 is in progress!
If you've ever read any other web serials, you might've noticed that authors get better with time (that is, their art or writing improves). Wutosama of Metaworld Chronicles noted that the first 20 chaps are always a mess.
This is also the case with Apex Predator. The first two parts (ranging just under 30 chapters, or 161 pages) are absolutely subpar. While I have edited them as of 7-10-18, they require a rewrite, which is currently in the works but not complete.
For a sample that gives insight into what the latter ~80% of the story's writing style is like, check out chapter 56.

Luckily, my two brothers who match my level of skill, albeit in different areas, tend to spice things up. When I look at my older brother I have no idea how he gets anything done when he's such an idiot. Still it doesn't detract from my respect for him as a gamer, though maybe a little. When I look at my younger brother I marvel at the monster that my older brother and I created. Deadliness, craftiness and quiet, both in what he does and how he is.
When it's just us three we tend to destory everything in our path. So normally we tend to compete rather than team. Although that isn't to say we're just good as individuals. When we work together our effectiveness multiplies rather than lowering.
Well enough about us dorks.
Anyway a new VR game came out, apparently in development for quite some time. Of course my older brother decided to drive out and buy three copies. What would this one be missing? Difficulty? Depth? Length? 
In any case I plan to reach the top before my brothers do. It was a competition after all.

This was only the natural result since he'd been doing nothing except process souls for over a hundred-thousand years. It didn't help that the only person he could socialise with was the occasional Hero or fellow Divine-level being that graced him with their presence. 
However, his chance to break this monotony had arrived. Two souls had disappeared from Earth. They didn't go to Olympus nor did they enter the Underworld. This peculiar change was the final nail in the coffin for Hades.
How did the God of Death react to this? Of course, he chose to finally quit his job! Be damned to the responsibilities! ... Nothing bad could happen if he left the throne of The Underworld for only a few decades, right?
Follow Hades as he lives amongst the mortals and tries to enjoy his new lease on life. Hopefully, his absence won't create any unforeseen consequences for Earth... hopefully.

10451,The War of Destiny (A Story from Vandaria),"This is the land of Vandaria, a world where frameless and human resides. Frameless is a magical race who put great importance on logical judgement while human is a race who is not blessed by magic, but has resilience and braveness to chalenge all limits.
However, for three thousand years, frameless was the absolute ruler of Vandaria. Human was nothing more than slave and servant of frameless. Humans were supressed and those who bear the blood of both human and frameless were ostracized.
Yet the wind of destiny could not be stopped. The spark of rebellion was ignited and the flame of war would engulf the whole Vandaria. This was a story about men and women, human and frameless, who seek for their places in destiny. There was no right and wrong. Each of them held their own belief, yet they were destined to fight between one and another.
This was the greatest war in the history of Vandaria. This was the War of Destiny.

This is not my first story, but this is my first story in english. I want to try writing a story in english because, seriously, it is VERY difficult.
This story was a high fantasy epic story with multiple PoVs, like Song of ICe and Fire books. This is a bit out of my league, but I will do my best.
It was based on an existing fantasy franchise in my country, called Vandaria Saga. Thus, I do not take any credit for world-building and lore.

That should teach them not resurrect people into dungeon cores.
Now it is too late. He has a perfect plan to become the best dungeon on the continent and nothing will stand in his way. Especially something called common sense. 

Disclaimer of sorts:
I am non-native English writer that used to write mostly for himself. After my last computer decided to die on me taking all my works with it I lost the desire to write for quite a long time. This is my attempt to go find motivation to write again as this was my favourite hobby. The idea is to be held accountable. 
As for being non-native, I don't believe that should be a major issue as I feel my proficiency in English to be sufficient enough to not be too much of the distraction. That said, be forewarned that the rules governing punctuation are beyond my grasp. All I can do is try not to completely suck at that.
As mentioned this is an attempt to motivate me to write again so any message, encouragement or constructive criticism will go long way.

Not just once... but twice? The great Emperor of the galaxy, yet defeated by a mere monkey? No! This is not how my story will end! I refuse to return that hell!
Until I have reclaimed my birthright as the ruler of all things I will not rest!

Frieza had been killed... twice. 
Yet as he was destined to be sentenced once more to the same agonizing hell from whence he had crawled out of, his fate had changed. This time around was different. It was not hell that he had been returned to but he was given a 'second chance' as he was reincarnated into a different world altogether. This was no longer the world in which he had ruled, but a world rife with vermin that did not know who he was. They had not bowed their heads in fear and awe of his presence and wielded strange powers known as 'magic'. Even for the galactic emperor, this world housed many odd species that he had not seen before, but this was perfect as he could soon teach them what it mean to be 'conquered'.
He was the galactic overlord; Frieza refused to follow the same path as these vermins and he would assert hs dominance the way he knew how. 'Magic?' he would not lower himself to the standard of insects but overwhelm them with the techniques that had earnt him his title in the first place.

10496,The Fate of The Summoned (being ReWritten),"The Fate of The Summoned
 
In the world of Aethion things are vastly different than on Earth. There is Magic and Monsters, as well as Demons and Dragons. Throughout the history of the world there have been many wars, both between all the various nations and kingdoms and between those nations and kingdoms and the Demonic forces lead by a Demon King or Lord. There are times that the Demons gain so much more power than the other nations, or that the others are embroiled in a war against each other and the lone nation is targeted by the demons. It was during these occasions that the various Gods and Goddesses started giving two things to the races. The First of these things were the Blessings, magical blessings given to the worth for chosen things. The Second of these things were the Summoning rituals, magic rituals that could summon beings from somewhere else, that would be Chosen, by the gods. These beings have almost always come from our world, Earth.



It has been centuries since this practice began and the countries of the world have almost always flourished for a time after a Chosen or group of them were Summoned. All of the countries treat the Summoned well, almost like kings or princes in their own right. Well, not all countries, there are some that have treated them almost like slaves, though those countries don’t usually last long. There is one though, that has lasted, for a long time due to their connection to their Patron Deity, the Goddess of Light. They only accept certain types of Summoned and they dote on certain members of the country more than others. Several years ago they performed a summoning, as they were being plagued by overflow from the dungeons. Now they, like the other countries of Aethion, have performed the ritual to fight against the current Demon King, who is said to possess a Blessing.
This is a story about Fate, and those that fight against it and those who accept it. In this story the main character(s) do not fight their fate, like those in my other story, rather they embrace it and let it shape them, though that does not mean they are total slaves to it. While there will be similarities to most other Hero sumoning novels, i hope the Mcs abilities and such will make it unique.",75

-NOTICE- CHANGE OF SCHEDULE-
Due to some IRL stuff, I am forced to change the schedule for Re:Interference. Because of that, I will make two major changes to the schedule.

That means, one week I could release it on friday, the next one on sunday etc... whenever a chapter is ready (writing, editing, proofreading of 9000+ words) it will be released.
If you read this, please do keep in mind that:

English is not my native language (so, by all means, if you spot bad grammar/ wrong terms etc take your time to leave a comment, it will help me a lot)

2012, humans started disappearing.
At the start of each month, a handful, going on to the tens, hundreds and even thousands of humans would disappear.
Governments, scientists and even the priests, they all did what they could.
But... what can they do?
With a single flash of light, poof goes a person. Nothing more, nothing less.

This is my first time writing a story, i dont know if you guys will receive it well or not. I started to read LN from NU and RL, and it enchanted me. But unfortunately the author and translator are humans too so they couldnt keep up with my reading rate. From what i had read, i started to imagine what if the world like this, or what if this character had an ability like this or what if the decision the character made was different than the stories.
All of that keep coming up as i read, and then a few weeks ago i started to write what i imagine into a new story. Through writing the story i learnt that making a story isnt as easy as imagine. I must think of name, plot, character personalities, the environment, etc. Then one day i decided, fuck it lets post it first and see how it is going to be.
To tell you the truth i like chinese martial arts story better but i cant make chinese name since i dont know the language. I learnt from the internet that creating a random name in Chinese is dangerous so i make this story to be Japanese like western story. But i still want to add martial arts and cultivation element to it.
I will write what my imagine is like, something will be changed along the way thats for sure but i hope you guys will understand it. Each chapter will at least have 1500 words but i am not so good at english so correct me if there is something wrong with my grammar. I post this so that i can share what i imagine. One last thing, i like OP Main Character and although i dont hate training plot but i dont like weak main character.
I hope you like what i write, any critics and suggestion is welcomed so write it on comment section so we can discuss it with the others.
 
Warning
For you guys that dont like OP Main Character, bad language, violence, and maybe in the future there will be NSFW content, dont read it
For those who seek perfection, you wont find it here
Strategy, Business Management, Trickery not my forte so dont seek it here but i will try to make it if possible
Character skills will randomly appear as i tried to think what op skill i want for my character so bear with it
Plot will be good, well i hope so if not then bear with it",100

People dressed as clowns and monsters from horror movies prance around the streets spooking onlookers and children searching for treats. Through the terrifying delight that extends over the Earth on this day, a true wicked influence lurks about. Its agents of mischief and sin are entwined throughout the world, waiting to thrust through the surface and hash out true villainy unto the unsuspecting victims called humans. However, heroes, humans with unique abilities, claim to be able to protect their kind with their strength. Not without being paid by the government, of course.

Some things you should know about my 'writing process'  before continuing here. Each chapter falls within an outline, and the story overall is meant to have a loose three-act structure, but the details consist more of my fantasies and dreams than planned content and may seem a bit disjointed at the first go. Additionally, while I run my writing through some grammar programs before posting, I will post for a couple of days before doing another read-through and revision, fixing the autocorrect errors, and working the text into something of a second (vastly more readable) draft. As such, modifications to content are expected and will take place at any time.
I don't intend to publish. I write these stories down to get them out of my head and sleep at night. I post them here because my fantasies are sadly missing from contemporary fiction, and I hope to inspire others to write books and stories, in turn, that I would like to read.

Read what other people are saying about this book! 
""The story makes no sense. The author meanders from one uninspired trope to another with no rhyme or reason in between. Moreover, gore and truly grotesque sexual perversions are sprinkled throughout in a way that does not add to the story, but rather is clearly just a sad attempt by the author to gross their audience out without rhyme or reason. Zero out of ten.""  - Kevin Johnson
""I truly cannot recommend this author's writing to anyone. Their attempts at 'books' meander along, often petering out without any kind of payoff or reward after hundreds of pages of barely comprehensible rambling. I'd ask to speak to their Manager, but if anyone were managing them at all, their work wouldn't be the steaming pile of trash that it is today."" - Misses Tiffany Lockheart

This will be a mature read. I do not plan to make it light and will probably contain  psychological questions pertaining to life and our existence as a whole. It may contain detailed illustrations of scenes that, according to some, may not be the most morally correct.
No plot armor or easy strolls in the park for the characters. Every little thought and action counts. The smallest mistakes can lead to disasters. No one is saved from the sweet embrace of the maiden Death.
Frequent and quality updates. The rate of upload depends on my free time. I will try to upload at least 10 000 words worth of quality content each week. If you find any mistakes, please do point them out in the comments. I am a normal human being afterall, one or two are bound to slip through my fingers.

10792,Survivor: An Age of Steel and Myth,"When people think of the world ending, they usually come up with some idea of a Zombie or Nucular apocolypse. The reality was a bit different.
The world ended in a hacking cough, due to an illness that had infected the lands around us. A group of 'terrorists' wanted to create a symbiotic disease that would force humanity to evolve as they said that Humanity was a stagnant species doomed to kill ourselves. So they made a biological weapon, a virus that acted like a bacteria, fully capable of self-evolution. It was made to infect only humans and nothing else. It was made to push humanity to the next level of existance, to unlock the latent potential hidden within our minds. They released it across the world in highly populated cities, from New York to Hong Kong. No country was safe, as only a single person would enter a country with this virus, and when two hundred people invaded the hundred and ninety something countries the signal was given.
The world as we knew it ended in a week. Durring that time, people started to mutate, change into monsters and undead creatures. Durring all this time I was sick, locked in my room as I lived of medications in order to keep a horrible cold at bay. I never knew of how the airports transported this disease across the world, of how the miltary was infected and unable to fight, of how humanity hid in bunkers to try and survive. I was busy being locked up in my apartment, and it wasn't until three weeks after the world ended that I was able to head outside.",9

This is not a Historcal fiction nor a Fanfic even if it does have some simmiiarities to the two (i.e. using the term glaive or officer ranks from Kingdom or a name of a former or modern country).

10820,The Runesmith,"A Bad Man Gets Badder
My name is Harald Runestorm.
In real life, I help children with their homework and volunteer in a library project for homeless refugees (due to a probation order), but in my spare time, I log into the World of the Greenwood and kill people for fun.
Sometimes I torture them too, and I generally rob them, but other days I stay in my tower and craft things.
One day, from a shady informant,  I heard about a shipment of gold ore through the woods. It seemed the Druids Guild was taking its gold diggings to market, so I thought I’d take it off them. I’ve always hated hippies, with their 'respect the woods' and 'pet butterflies' attitude to life. I wanted them to respect my sword and pet my fist. My Runefist that is. With their face.
I went down to the woods to teach them a lesson about pain and loss. Then I learned a lesson myself.
 A LitRPG short story (15,280 words!) set in The World of The Greenwood MMO.

10823,The Ascendant: Endless Reincarnation,"My name is Richard Brooks. I died while saving a kid.
Kicking the bucket at 28 was really depressing, you know? There’s so much I still wanted to do.
But instead of passing on, I was thrust into an endless series of reincarnations. Whenever I die, I earn Karma points based on my achievements and growth. These points can be exchanged for weapons, spells, or other bonuses to make my next lives more interesting.
“What kills me only makes me stronger!” Or something like that. 
Honestly, it feels like I’m stuck in an RPG. The difficulty setting can be pretty ridiculous too.
Sometimes all I can do is grit my teeth in frustration as I die an ignoble death.
But I won’t complain. Even when it’s dangerous and painful, I love life. This is all an opportunity; I’ll do my best, no matter what kind of sadistic fate the System throws at me.
I will swing the warhammer of justice! Craft and enhance the most amazing artifacts! Overwhelm opponents with a barrage of auto-casting spells! Lead powerful vassals in Domain wars!
All for the sake of creating an eternal sanctuary.
With my unique power of Runecrafting, maybe I’ll even become strong enough one day to overturn fate… or at least find out what the hell is really going on.
It might take a few hundred or a thousand lifetimes, but what’s the rush?
I have all the time in the world now.

Author Notes: Hello! This isn't my first attempt at writing a story, and it isn't even my first attempt at writing this particular story, but I'm not in any way what I would call ""experienced"". I decided to upload my writing here because I just wanted to get my ideas out there, and I wanted to get some constructive criticism for my writing from the RRL community. All comments are welcome, but please try to keep them positive and constructive! If you leave a rating, I would appreciate it if you left a short explanation of what you liked and what I can improve on.
I'll be uploading each chapter as I finish them, but this is still the first draft so anything and everything is subject to change. The cover art is drawn by me, but I'm in no way married to it. I just wanted something that showed the three magical sources, as I picture them in my head. If you do any art based on this story, send it to me! I would love to see it.

In the future, story will contain more mature content, you have been warned.

The protaganist, Ravel, is reborn as a member of a dying race, the Vishna. His people have been hunted to near extinction by the humans of Essel. Will Ravel be able to do what he has to in order to survive in his second life or will he be condemned by his human weakness.
Author's note: The race of the protaganist is heavily influenced by the ghouls from Tokyo Ghoul with many notable differences. The protaganist, while not a sociopath, has rather flexible morals when push comes to shove. Some people like an evil protaganist with no regard for human life. Some prefer a selfless hero. Ravel is somewhere in the middle.

'This whole world is suspicious...'
 
Despite the fact that Haruki had never once met a god, even during his reincarnation, he couldn't help feeling that this world was just too... Intelligently designed?
I mean, seriously... Levels? Classes? Stats? Items? You can even level up your abilities!
 
'Definitely suspicious...'
 
Unfortunately, the Church have been keeping close tabs on him from the shadows. They've heard rumours of a boy, born with a golden ring. With magical affinities that defy logic. Darkness and light energies destroy each other, violently, so how does he have the affinity for both?
 
Can Haruki live his peaceful life along side childhood friend Suzu? Or will they fall to the coming darkness?
 
 
::Author's note::
While there are stats and exp etc, it's not LitRPG. They are there, but not the focus in any way. The world is more hardcore - A human is soft, so a pierced lung should eventually kill them. Even though they have a small pool of HP, a single deadly blow can end it all. If you ever want to say G'day, I'm in the discord chat every now and then, so feel free to join the madness ;)

AUTHOR NOTE : This is going to just be a hobby novel, And, My first real novel that I'm posting, so please be patient. If I'm not uploading it means I've been kidnapped by the CIA Lazy and have decided to not write anymore. The Genre's will be decided as time goes on.
 
Expect Adorableness, attempts at cool scenes, an Snarky Narrator [If I feel like retorting to myself?] and a possibly sheer full course of random!
[Warning: Novel may up up turning into a steaming pile of horrible steamed meat balls]





 





 
Do Not Expect
Characters dying for the sake of dying
Ex: Mc's Mom tripped on a rock and choked to death on her spit, causing a traumatic childhood.
 
Characters getting together, because they have the right body parts.
Ex: Heroine loved Main Character because of his sword and was nice ONCE, not the 'friend' who saved her life many times and the two of them just belong together, but that 'friend' does not have a sword of her own.
Be warned that there could be any Bi-Sexual, Homo-sexual, Hetero-Sexual relationship in my Fictions.
Be warned, Helicopter-kin Will most likely be offended
 
Anything
Ex: Nothing will make sense if you expect too much, But I would appreciate feedback, But I may be too lazy to change anything.
Boring Action Scenes
Ex: Main character blah blah blah [20 lines later] and finally punches slime A, Just no, This is fun not torture!
 
PS - Please suggest Tags, Thx [Because typing thanks takes too long] These tags will be updates as the story goes on.  Oh, and please keep in mind I'm making the plot as I'm writing, though I may make polls so that the plot doesin't become steaming meat buns while they are not shaped properly, a dishonor to any family.

Going to the future is merely called living. If one wants to see the distant future, all it takes is figuring out how increase their life span, by one way or another. Be it for 100 years 200, or a thousand years. But by doing this, you eliminate all the things you know all the certainty’s in life and simply travel into the unknown.

Such a fact rings true even for the fabled Lone Immortus, a powerful nine-tailed Golden Foxkin. However, what would you do if your monotony was suddenly ground to a halt and you were thrown out of your comfort zone along with a young girl forgotten by time?
Perhaps you might have done things differently, been more organised, immediately died, gained control of the world in a matter of days, but this is Lone's tale, not yours.
Watching two insecure people struggle to survive and find their place in an unfamiliar land just might be enjoyable to witness. Who knows? One thing's for certain: it won't be an easy path for them to tread, and what could possibly be more entertaining than watching people endure hardships and grow?
I know of at least eight gods that would answer with, 'Absolutely nothing.'
I wonder, after seeing this journey from start to finish, how would you answer?

10939,When Plush comes to Shove,"An: So the last synopsis wasn’t really all that good, it was just some mumbo jumbo with no actual point to it so I decided to make a new one that’s a bit more accurate.
Leo Lush, just your average everyday (slightly chubby) schmuck, or at least he would be if he didn’t carry around a stuffed toy everywhere he went.I mean, he was a man who could read the atmosphere a bit so put it away in his bag whenever having a stuffed toy out would be rude but other than that he brought it with him all the time, it was a memento from his girlfriend who had died three years ago and keeping it close made him feel better.
That’s also why his classmates gave him the nickname “Plush”, though that's neither here nor there.
One day at the train station he’d lost his dearest stuffed toy, one of his classmates found it and lobbed it towards him, something that they’d already done many times before, but this time something went wrong and Leo found himself falling in front of the train due to the force of the throw.
Now follow Leo as the spirit that developed in his stuffed toy and killed him forces his ghost into another world to possess a different stuffed toy.
He doesn’t know much about the world or why he’s there but what he does know is that according to a magic book his girlfriend was also sent to this very world when she died in a plane accident three years ago.
An: For those who want to know a bit more about what kind of story this will be: I want it to be a chill feel-good story and stay as far away from those despair-fest stories as possible (No offense to people who enjoy them, I’m just not one of you)Let me make something clear; I’m not writing this story with hope of it becoming really top tier among RRL (Though it did get above rank 500 once which I’m still very proud of even though it’s gone back down to ~850 at the time of writing this) I just want to write a story that I would enjoy reading, that’s why I’ll be mostly skipping over a lot of the parts that I skip when I read other stories, such as stats, the exact value of money and other such precise statistics that no one(as far as I’m aware) really cares about all that much. Just feels like a lot of effort for something superfluous.There’s a single exception and that’s one of the battles, it’s not a despair-fest or anything but it’s got a different feel than the rest of the story due to me being in a funky mood while I was writing it.",300
