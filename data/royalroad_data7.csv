19003,Almighty Dung [Dropped],"Have you seen the future?
I have not, nobody did, no one can.
I see...have you heard of apotheosis' prophecy?
What about it?
Many didn't take it seriously, probably because nobody could crack its mysteries, but the indestructible prophecy rock has recently crumbled. It is a sign that things will change.
...What did the prophecy say?
Sigh, you really don't know anything. There was a furnace drawn on the prophecy rock. There were three objects in it, named meaningless crown, black star and incomplete cross. When three signs appear the beast will awaken.
Has the meaning been cracked?
There are many hypothesis, but nothing concrete. The first object could have relation to king of some sorts, but in this vast universe there are many worlds, counties and kings. Who can really guess its meaning? It can also be metaphorical.
What about black star?
They say the second clue leads to eclipse, but this also says nothing. 
Third one?
Cross is the symbol of divinity. The cracked cross might mean a lot of things, like person who wants to go against progenitor's ideas and laws and forcefully achieve divinity...It could also mean destruction of divinity, but something like that should be impossible...
You're overthinking things. How could gods stay idle if someone is threatening their reign?Also, even if somebody is forcefully awakening, the gods will be alerted by commotion and won't let it succeed... Say, do you think that awakening beast is the one who will try to become one of us?
Most likely. No, it's hard to say. The prophecy can't be that simple. This is nothing but wild guesses from our side. Alright, let's stop with depressing stuff. I found a nice place not too far from my domain constellation. 
Really? What's special about it?
Nothing we've not seen before, except for a rare delicacy. They call it chocolate.
Oh? Is it delicious?
Yes, much better than slime candies you've been fond of. Are you free now?
Of course!
Then it's my treat. Be careful though, the sovereign over there is a bit low key, but very strong. You need to get to know world's customs first, we don't need extra trouble.
No problem. We have nothing to do anyway, haha. What are we waiting for? Lead the way...

19007,Having a Common Game Ability In Normal Life,"As long as i can remember, i can see something other people can't see
Yes, on the top right of my vision, i have something that looks like a map, does it useful? how does something that blocks 1/32 of my vision to be useful? Does it have to be useful.. right?
As i get older, this looks like ""mini-map"" in a video game that i played, so i decided to call this Mini-map
at least I'm not the only one with this kind of thing.. from what I've found, everyone has different ability, for example my little sister can see another person status, there's a person that can heal wounds by eating meat, there's a person that once a day can spin roulette to get reward, there's a person that can jump twice in the air and there's a person that can throw fireballs..... wait a minute!?

the story will be slow, since i just write this to train my english
anyhow the idea of this story will be
if someone can throw a fireball does their hand burns?
if someone can jump for 30m can they survive the fall?
if a bard play a song that can regen their allies, why’s the enemy isn’t regenerating?
if a cleris creates a barrier can their allies attack from inside barrier?
and About the first few chapter
i know the grammar was really bad
but it’ll help me if you guys read the first few chapter and go straight to the last and tell me have i improve or not

19008,On the Outskirts of Minazuki,"Might contain a bit of profanity on the later chapters, but the language may be softened up from the translation. I just kept it on just in case.
This was from the old story that I TL'd to English. The old one's already completed, I was just doing some TL and editing the parts where it didn't make much sense. The plot would be unchanged so you could enjoy it regardless.
Basically this was my attempt on making a lighter Yuri story, more on the side of Shoujo-ai I guess. The story was about two childhood friends who grew up in the small town and attended the same Middle School in a big city connected by the railways. One day, their feelings blossomed towards another and they start to tread towards this path of 'Forbidden Love'. Well that's pretty cliched lol. Their antics were sometimes kinda absurd though.
Anyway, I couldn't explain much. It all start when I thought about writing one based on trains, or was it a train station? Oh well, I totally forgot. I was just happy I could finish an actual story from the way back. Now I felt so goddamn rusty lol.",9
19009,The Black Eagle,"When a civil war begins in the Demon Realm, the king is forced to send his child to the Human Realm. 3000 years later, a young man named Guild leaves home for an enlightening adventure. However, his path is filled with everything but light...",2
19010,Adventures of one dude with an afro,"...East-Blue, West-Blue, South-Blue, and North-Blue are the four seas that constitute most of the whole planet. Humanity is thriving on the small patches of land which poke out of the four seas. These four seas are separated horizontally by a humongous mountain which encircles the whole planet, called Red Line, and vertically by, the most dangerous sea known to man, Grand-Line. Both sides of Grand-Line are flanked by strips of the windless sea called Calm Belt. The eternally windless strips of sea are impossible to cross with only wind-powered ships. It might be calm over the water, but the water hides nasty beings called sea kings, not to be disturbed as the name suggests.
 
People in this world can train themselves past any and all physical limits, only their mentality is the problem. A strong mind makes the body strong. Everyone in this world possesses this almost magical power in them called haki. There are three types of haki, two available to everyone and the last one is seen only once in seven million people. Different haki can be used to strengthen the body to even affect logia users, to predict and to foresee attacks, sense others’ prowess and even exert your will upon others.
 
Fruits of the sea devil. Otherwise know as devil fruits, give miraculous powers to those who eat them, but robs them of their power to swim and makes them vulnerable to anything from normal seawater to the crystallized power of the sea, sea stone. Devil fruit powers are categorized into three different categories: Zoan type fruits allow their users to transform into an animal of a sort and gain their abilities. There are also human and mythical type zoans so they should actually be called transformation powers but those ones are extremely rare to the point of none existent that most just associate zoan transformations into animals. Logia fruits make their eaters become the element that the fruit was. For example, the one who eats the fire logia fruit is able to use fire in their attacks, become fire to avoid physical attacks and much else. Last but not least are the Paramecia fruits, these fruits are undoubtedly the weirdest and most random of the bunch. There are some that let you attract metal, make you slim and slippery, make your body able to split your body into many pieces, makes your body rubber, lets you control vibrations, light, pressure almost anything you can imagine.
 
Lastly, there are two opposing factions in this world. The marines and the pirates, most strong people are part of either one. Both have their ups and downs. Pirates are free people who do whatever they want. Good or Bad. Marines are the upholders of justice in this world yet no justice system is without corruption.

 I go on to save damsels in distress and add them to my harem. Unite the fractured lands and gain powerful items to help strengthen me, making contracts with rare and powerful spirits for more power.

==================
Now this one is a bit of an interesting one to put on here because it is a sequel to an earlier fanfic I made right here. I'm not planning on posting it here due to it being complete and set in a universe I would call non-canon for the purposes of the events in this fanfic. This one is essentially a standalone fanfic with references to characters in the earlier fic. I tried to disconnect it as much as possible by re-describing characters. If I didn't do a good enough job, I could post the prequel in its entirety, but I don't see the point in it.

The chapters will be quite short at the beginning so sorry about that in advance.
This isn't an evolution story even though it starts out like that. The MC will get a humanoid body in the early chapters.
In many of the stories in RRL there are those shadowy organizations, assassins guilds, and criminal syndicates that aren't really the main focus. So that's what I'm aiming for in this story. It tells the tale of the demon who built such an organization and the motivations that drove him.

To those worried that I will drop yet another fiction here is an update. I've re-read some of my earlier works and I'm not proud of the way most of the stories were written(very focused on rape and gore). Most of those were written at 3 am in the morning. It is the summer right now and I have a great deal of time to write into this newly inspired story, so while there might not be a consistent uploading schedule, this will definitely be a continued endeavor. Anyways, please give this one a try. It'll have some game mechanics in it that will be rather different from most of the book I've read on this site as well as a completely new take on an apocalyptic world compared to my other ""works.""

Goblin King is the first novel of the Monster Slayer Online LitRPG/Gamelit series. If you loved The 100, the Monster Hunter game franchise, and Dragon's Dogma, you'll enjoy this fast paced, hard-action monster-slaying novel. 
Note: This is a high-action/combat oriented LitRPG story with a focus on mythology (including an in-game codex/bestiary that pops up with new creatures). This story leans darker than the traditional norms in the genre. Please take this into consideration.

If you are interested in a collection of works or a larger piece then I am willing to offer discounts depending on the project. I will also reduce the price if you allow me to publish the piece.

Author's note: Please suggest possible setting he could visit in the comments. I'll gather ones i'm familiar with, and at the end of every arc, a poll will be held to decide the next location he visits. There will be polls for other purposes, and I might not always go with the poll winner if I feel one of the other options is more fun to read/write about. I will not use the settings of other RRL writers without their permission.Do not ask for that, unless the author in question gives permission. Most settings he visits will be slightly AU in some way or another, but please remind me if I drift too far from canon unintentionally or characterize a character wrongly. This work will eventually fit all tags I selected once he visits universes suited to those tags, so don't ask when or where a given tag is coming.
I do not own the cover art, it belongs to Nicholas Belanger Thiel, and I will stop using it if he asks me to. Kellan doesn't look like the old man on the cover, though once he acquires a disguise-type ability he may occasionally use that appearance. The tapir, however, will be a thing, as despite looking like a failed attempt at an elephant, tapirs are cool and this dragon finds them to be kinda cute.

19129,Unfold,"Prologue
 
The town of Raines, crowded with people walking about the streets, doing their own businesses. The sellers sell and the buyers buy. The parents parent and, the children run and play around with one another. It was still morning but it was already filled with the noise of the soon-to-come busy afternoon. The tables in the bars were surrounded by the drunk and the lost, as the bartenders served ales to their customers and waved them off and outside, walking among the streams of people, was a figure cloaked in a black cloth. Face hidden in the shadow of the hood’s shadow, that particular someone or something walked towards a bar with the massive-looking sign
                                                      ~Fountain of wealth~
And below it, hung a sign smaller than it with a text carved into it.
                                                Only the best SHIT is served here!
From beneath the hood, the hidden figure took a quick look at the sign before turning to the wooden door before it. Taking in a deep breath, it entered.
An entirely new layout unfolded before the widely-opened eyes. Tons of wooden crates and barrels scattered across the room as vulgar-looking men and women had their share of joy, gulping down bottles of beer and spitting out nonsense before refilling their glas- Oh yea, they didn’t fill their glasses, nor bottles with alcohol. These were the professionals! They drank it straight from the barrels…
‘Hey,kiddo! What exactly is a kid like you doing in here?’ Asked a buff-looking man, walking towards the cloaked figure, and stand, towering over it by a few heads. ~And did I mention about the bald plain that took the place of his hair?   P.S. I could see my reflection in it. ~  Instantly, or almost instantly, a female voice rose from beneath the hood.
‘I am giving you one chance,’ She said.
‘Hey hey! You threatening me here, kid?’
‘One chance…’ She took in a deep breath again, pausing momentarily. ‘One chance to…SPARE ME!’ From standing on her two feet a second ago to falling down on her knees and holding the man’s pants in her grip, the man was taken aback by her sudden shift in tone and action. He stood there looking confused.
‘I-I will let you go this time but don’t expect a second chance, you hear me?’
‘Oh, thank God! Thank you, miste-’ Suddenly, the man grabbed her hands and a furious glare was fixed on her. ‘M-Mister…?’ He clutched her  hair tightly then, lifted her up to his head easily.
‘I warned you that there’s no second chance,’ His eyes narrowed further. ‘ NO SECOND CHANCE! YOU HEAR ME?’ She could only utter a soft ‘Yes’, as she fought against the pain at the roots of her hair. Minutes ago, she was in the bar, barely escaping the cruel reality of the adults and now, she was out, lying on the warm concrete ground after getting kicked out. Everyone stared at her as they passed her by. She laid there, not moving. She laid there, holding her tears in. And, she laid there, muttering.

19133,I Be Young: A Portal Fantasy,"A portal fantasy.
Don't have a proper synopsis yet but this kinda starts with a school arc. Then it becomes a Terrace House or housemates-like situation with interspersed visits to the (probably low fantasy) secondary world. There's a bit of magic but it'll probably be mainly about dialogue or character interactions. And building nations or groups in general. Expect lots of worldbuilding and slice of life stuff. I'm not too keen on fight scenes or war scenes, but it's a staple of the genres I want to combine, so I'll do my decent effort.
To be honest, I think it can be boiled down to: a clash of cultures. Or something along those lines.
The modern/current day situation is based around Crusader Kings Two. In particular, the Historical Immersion Project mod's 1043 bookmark. That's where the timeline ""diverges."" Long story short: Leon/Castile/Spain ""rebuilds"" the Roman Empire with the eastern/northern border stopping on the banks of the Dnieper or something in Russia. There's also some population switching and such as Spain/Hispania rearranged the world. It's where most of the slice of life stuff will occur, I guess, as the current situation in this timeline is much like ours: increasing peace.
The secondary world or alternate world is based on parts of Xianxia, Isekai, et cetera that I like. It should be somewhat original. It's studded with GameLit or LitRPG or whatever stuff too. It'll be medieval age, maybe way before the Renaissance or its equivalent. Still not sure yet, but it's for sure going to have kings, wars, and so on.
Forgive my writing, it's sourced from my idiolect. The pop culture references, relexification, or lazy writing are okay to me. But eh. I kinda just wanted to get this out there before the traditionally published LitRPG or Portal Fantasy blitz.",1
19134,Tales of a Variant,"A Variant. A humanoid being with similarities to humans or elves but with extremely varied eyes, hair, and skin.

For the most part they stick to themselves but occasionally you can find the rare loner wandering on their own. This is where our story begins, with a Variant by the name of Corvo a Variant with the memories of a man from another life in another world with different views. This is the tale of Corvo the Hero.
This story is partially inspired by Skyrim, Dragons Dogma and probably a lot of other stuff I’m forgetting to mention. I plan to make this a series of short stories centering around the adventures of Corvo the story is semi reader interactive and I’m always happy to read your comments so hit me with whatever you have in mind even if you think it sucks.",6

It is not suggested to read this story without first reading World Keeper, as most of the content would not be properly understood without that context.

19144,The Crucible - (Terror Infinity Fanfic),"There has always been those that stood out from the crowd.  Heroes of old, undefeated warriors and demigods battling beasts of myth.  These stories are written off as fiction and folk stories of ignorant people long lost to time.  Nothing to prove them true except old family stories but what if people just weren't looking in the right place.

“Do you want more than this life?  Want to live… a real life?”  YES/NO
 

Who hasn't read Terror Infinity and thought I wonder what upgrades I would choose.  I love the Web Novel and Side B.  I did change a lot but the basic premise is still the same.
Feel free to leave thoughts and suggestions in the comments.  This is my first attempt at writing and I haven't done much of it since I left University 13 years ago.  This is also more of a hobby than trying to become an author but that doesn't mean I will drop it just don't expect fast releases.  I will mainly work on an Arc and post the arc's chapters in groups when I finish a whole arc.  Kinda like Side B used to be.",53

Together, they will learn to walk. Together, they will explore a virtual game world created by over twenty-two hundred of the universe’s artificial intelligences, a masterpiece in gaming history. Together they will embark on a journey, across vast distances of unexplored lands as she reaches forth on an impossible journey in the world of Terramore Online.
For her, this will allow her to live the life she always wanted, free from her sterilized home and her useless legs.
To be free also means she needs to follow the Doctor’s orders, which means she needs to attend a virtual university where not all is as it seems.
Join Emera and Era on their journey in the Pod universe, for it will be a good one!

These people live in fear, reduced to picking off the remains of their once great civilization. The ones responsible for this duty are the scavengers, brave souls who scour the rotting skeletons of humanity's past to try and rebuild elsewhere.
Chase is a scavenger, a good one if he had a say in it. Though Chase rarely has a say in anything so he prefers to keep quiet. As a new type, he's not well liked in his village, though he doesn't really understand why. Besides his ability barely qualifies him as a new type, that was until he hit his limit and didn't stop.

19206,Lone: The Wanderer,"A story about a history teacher gaming-addict with familial trauma, and a peculiar woman seemingly stuck out of time and beyond out of touch.
The two have been thrust into the weird and whimsical world of Altros, a planet with divides born of very real superhuman strength courtesy of an odd ranking system, and, naturally, species differences.
Not exactly the best of news for our resident Scottish history teacher whose ears have changed into fox ones alongside his nine new fluffy tails.
First though, Darren, or Lone, or whatever else the weird system claims he's called, has to figure out how to live with his new companion Sofia, for seemingly forever while also just barely managing to survive being stranded on a monster-infested island with a self-proclaimed former-immortal who can see despite being blind, can freely teleport, and who also, of course, seems prone to experiencing bouts of extreme depression.
Not an ideal situation when he himself hasn't been in a great headspace for over a decade now. But hey, at least there's an incredibly expansive litRPG system to keep the both of them entertained, right? That'll fight off the fear of death, surely.

The most powerful demihuman, the Fae King Eseit, and his wife, the most powerful of the dragonkin, Yrlett, were unlikely to ever produce a child, due to the difference of their races. Or so they believed, proven wrong when Yrlett one day laid a single egg. For years and years, they waited patiently for their egg to hatch, so that they might finally have a family of their own making. Unfortunately, the couple missed the hatching of the egg, and so their newborn child wandered off into the world of humans and demihumans, causing them no small amount of panic. In her anger, Yrlett kicked up a great fuss, sending shockwaves throughout the human empire, shockwaves that brought the old human powers out of the dark. In order to appease the anger of the former human emperors, Yrlett and Eseit agreed to arrange a marriage between their son and the granddaughter of the previous emperor of the human empire.
However, things are not looking entirely peaceful for their world, as the System begins to hint at impending disaster. Elsewhere in the world, demonic forces are on the rise and the unsuspecting forces of the humans and demihumans are unfit to counter their future assaults. In its foresight, the System has acted as much as its limitations allowed. The System chose to empower the human and demihuman forces so that they will not fall under the tides of war, by blessing Esyr, son of Eseit and Yrlett. However, with his inability in mastering his abilities and none that can show him the way, the young future hero will have a tough road ahead, with the fate of human and demihuman society, and even the System's existence itself on his shoulders.",25

As their eyes met, both of them weary, but Kaine's expression was resolved...maddened almost.
Whilst his foe's was fear-struck, the creature was terrified down to its core.
As were its comrades which surrounded them, watching, waiting for an opening to have at Kaine themselves.
Seeing many...but they faltered, as the dead had seen the same openings before.
Their battered, broken and still freshly bleeding bodies laying sprawled about their surroundings.

Author's note: Thank you so much to everyone who supported book one, Goblin King, on its Amazon release this past May. The overwhelming kindness was both mind-blowing and humbling to see from this community. Thank you. Please note that this series is a high action/combat oriented RPG style. It may not be what you're looking for.

What people are saying about book one, Goblin King:
 ""An awesome debut to the LitRPG scene. R.R. Virdi's, Monster Slayer Online: Goblin King, is a beautifully crafted story that had me up late reading to see what came next!"" Luke Chmilenko, author of the ground-breaking series, Ascend Online. 
  

""[A]n enjoyable action oriented novel with light RPG mechanics. The big focus in the story is on combat, which is written well. The fights are frenetic, visceral, and there's an good amount of variety among the bad guys."" LitRPG Podcast 
 
""Skyrim meets The 100 and Logan's Run. There's action from the get-go. The world is an interesting mix of dark fantasy (which I LOVE) and familiar open world fantasy games. "" Amazon Reviewer.
 
""Reading this book was an incredibly dangerous move on my part. You see, I'd been an avid fantasy gamer all through my teen years. There was nothing I loved better than delving into mythical worlds as a warrior, doing my part to save it. I spent hours in front of a PC, and I thought nothing could capture my imagination quite like the CG, epic music score, and glittering lore....turns out, I was wrong. This debut GameLit novel by R.R. Virdi brought back that love of everything fantastical."" Amazon Reviewer.Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope you enjoy book two as I serialize it here in rough/alpha.

It seems nothing has changed much since the famed EDSA Revolution of 1987. The year is 2042. Philippines has reached economic growth comparable to South Korea in 2022. Still, elite families control the government and social justice remains dismal. The younger population became increasingly materialistic while their parents are becoming more and more irresponsible. The problem has shifted from ""how to decrease population"" to ""how to make spoiled kids' and parents' ass off to work"". In terms of military power, the country has acquired considerate amount of firepower but remained one of the weakest in the ASEAN region thanks to politics. Worse, China and the USA has declared war against each other after a diplomatic blunder thanks to the incompetence of their respective new presidents. The world is doomed to a world war 3 while the Philippines was caught unprepared for war. Instead of finding solutions, politicians in the Philippines continued to blame their political enemies while the CBCP called everyone to prayer, hoping that God would make a miracle that make Philippines somewhat immune to nuclear weapons.

19331,Cultivation of a Phoenix,"I was falling, the strength leaving my body.  I was familiar with falling, though I usually controlled how I fell.  My wings were seizing up, tightening close around my body.  The wounds on my body were small, but bleeding heavily.  I could feel the projectiles that hit me lodge in my muscles or against my bones.  And so after falling for an eternity, but what I knew to be only moments I crashed into the ground...  I, who was a proclaimed king of the sky, was felled to the ground by man for my breed was rare and dying out of this world.  There on the ground I died.  I followed my body in the after-life for some time to see my body stuffed and put in a majestic pose upon a mantle in some old man's hall.  Seeing what had been done to my body I left it and passed on into the darkness of the void.",14

Author note: First time author, good amount of buffer chapters (over 50k words) so I will not drop this book anytime soon. This book will mostly be from the perspective of the MC. On average +5k words will be published per week.
I have not chosen some of the genres and tags as I do not wish to give away parts of the story. I added the content warning tags as there will come a time for profanities, gore and maybe ""traumatising"" content. Though, in my opinion the content will be mild if not light.
 
*****SPOILER*****SPOILER*****
Synopsis: A college ICT student transmigrates to another world filled with magic and learns magic from a dragon. MC uses modern knowledge to develop magitech technology. MC starts his adventure using the technology he develops! Saving princesses, fighting hidden criminal organizations, learning how horribly medieval peasants live, reasoning with uneducated narrow minded people, investigating the nature of magic and searching for gods...
Story review: A fantasy/sci-fi story filled with some common cliches yet presents somewhat original ideas and a few unexpected twists & turns here and there. This novel also explores a few of the commonly ignored topics concerning medieval fantasy like hygiene, culture, education(ignorance, narrow mindedness) and the fact that everybody is short because magical crops cost too much. Modern knowledge in such a setting can often times revolutionize the world if the protagonist is not an idiot or weak willed or thinks something stupid like he should not intervene in a society that systematically practices unequality of opportunity, slavery and other nasty things, of course sometimes the protagonist can be just unlucky by being enslaved, etc. In our case we are granted a protagonist who had an initial stroke of luck, learning magic from a dragon instead of struggling for years without it or randomly dieing. After that his luck goes down the drain. It is arguable whether the princess is a good stroke of luck or not, I digress. Anyway the challenges the protagonist must face will grow and no more luck or helping hands. After gaining enough power and security the protagonist will change the world for the better or at least give it a stronge push onto the right track. He will make a lot of lives better but things are never so simple and there is much more to this world than meets the eye...
Missing genres & tags: Fantasy, Sci-fi, Magic.

CREDITS TO WHOM THE OWNER OF THESE BEAUTIFUL PICTURES
Background - I picked up the BG because of the 8 swords. Though I removed the girl because it was some sort of a ritual and our MC is a guy.
The Swordsman - His look in the description was vastly different, but just think of him as a modern guy and that person in the cover was close. IMO. 

BIG CREDITS TO
- the person who points out the mistake of my cover.
vkg313 - the person who have a keen and sharp eyesight. He could look into the truth and mistakes of anything he wanted to see. Thus, unveiling the mistake of my cover. Instead of 'Eight Swords', it turned out to be just 'Eight Sword'. So thanks for the tip, and I appreciate it.",12

Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, more than 6 million Jews were murdered.
While much of Nazi Germany was devoted to the concept of anti-Semitism, there were equally as many who were revolted and appalled by these ideals.

19385,The Troll's Bridge Tavern,"This Synopsis Involves Limited Spoilers and Mockery of Spoilers
The Troll's Bridge Tavern is a satirical black comedy fantasy novel written to spite the fantasy genre while celebrating its absurdity.  Its author is an unreliable drunk ski bum who begs attention so that he can finally make his abusive mother proud.  Happy reading!
Fantasy novels suck.  In this one, a hobbit named Hildago tries to write his literary masterpiece; his quest for adventure depends upon finding that perfect group of questing adventurers which will find him riches, success, fame, and ultimately material for his great epic to solidify him in the annals of Hobbit literature. 
This first-draft novel-in-the-making is a constantly updated, expanding saga of satire on the fantasy, gaming, D&D, Tolkein, Rawling, and Dragonlance worlds of banal fantasy fiction with a literary twist written by an untrustworthy, jaded college drop out author who constantly interferes with the plot (is he/she another character?)
Can you trust Hildago? Probably not, because he will probably die (or will he?)  Should you root for the drunken Archmage Silas, the man responsible for the Cataclysm?  Or his tinkering gnomish butler, Rufus, the man who can make you a perfect martini; but resents his engineering background, and wishes Fate had not cursed him with science rather than magic?  How about Severn, the dashing steampunk airship pilot who may or may not appear in this story?  If you need your stories to have a Sapphic twist, Sigrid the Amazon might tickle your interest.",4

Not just any game mind you, it was the release of the first ever full dive VRMMORPG, cliche sounding I know but bear with me as I thought the same thing. Any explanation on how it was released is beside the point just know that it was and I, just as any self-respecting gamer would be was extremely fucking hyped for it.
The game was called 'Legend Has It' and the allure was that you would get to play as a god or spirit and interact with a vibrant world of NPC's. So I began to play, eager to experience this for myself, little did I know my life would change forever. 
So sit back, relax and let me regale you on how I got myself stuck in this predicament, for it starts with a boy, a game and a battle between gods.
Ominous I know, let's get started.",34

or forced to attend superhero fan club meetings with her best friend. She never understood the superhero craze but one night, she finds herself thrust into a mystery that threatens the city.

Dario was turned when he was twenty three, rendering him ageless. He had always been a ladies man, always having every girl in the room swoon over his good looks. 
 
There was only one mortal, however, that had ever caught his attention. She had the heart of a lion, and the soul of a fighter. She was stubborn, hard-headded, and had a way of always getting what she wanted.
 
The burning flame of passion she ignited within each and every thing she did, and everyone she met, intrigued him. With time, as he got to know her, he realised he was falling for her. In a way, she knew it too. The feeling was mutual.
 
One night, something terrible happened. Dario was left without his love, doomed to live an immortal life of solitude. 
 
He prayed to every God and Goddess he knew, hoping, wishing that someone would hear him.
 
Someone heard. Someone listened.
 
Seven hundred years later, the universe has given Dario a second chance. Leila has been reincarnated, and Dario was able to find her.
 
It appears Fate has given Dario a second chance at Eternity... Will he use it wisely this time?",0

A REAL HERO KNOWS HOW TO RISE TO THE OCCASION
Dennis is a second-year college student whose only luck with the ladies is ogling them from afar and picking up their misplaced bikini tops the morning after wild pool parties he never attends. Struggling to keep his 4.0 and to pay the rent for his crappy one-room apartment, he works late at Conan's Pizza and does poolside cleanup every morning before rushing to class. His hope that something better will one day come and his overactive Frazetta-inspired imagination are all that get him through the day. 
Dreams of slaying beasts to rescue babelicious women will soon be put to the test as his sudden gut-emptying illness turns out to be the side effects of desperate priestess magic from a world of savage-land hotties and nightmarish monsters.
With his newly bestowed herculean body and the aid, advice, and welcome attentions of his female companions, Dennis must learn the skills of a warrior, gain the heart of a champion, and fulfill the uniquely different desires of the women who choose to call him their man.
Facing deadly vagabonds, ravenous beasts, and mythical creatures, he does his best to survive the challenges of this new land and protect the women relying on him. But his hard work in college never prepared him for any of this, and especially not for the Dark One.
Disclaimer: This book has violent conflicts with both men and beasts. Cursing occurs throughout as the main character sees fit. This novel also includes a harem of women and all of the expected extracurricular activities with a red-blooded young man in such a situation.

19446,I didn't actually want to change ♂♀,"In the 21st Century, it's not uncommon for people to be transgender. Far more frequently than is publicly admitted, many individuals have thought to themselves that they feel like they were born as the wrong gender. For some people, this is merely a casual passing thought or an embarrassing guilty secret never to be spoken of again. For other people, these discordant feelings are so disturbing that they live on the edge of depression and suicide, a murky cloud looming over their heads as they attempt to suppress their deep-set feelings in order to desperately fit in with society.Every once in a while, you might encounter somebody who was brave enough to take the nerve-wracking leap to begin ""transitioning"" into a life as the other sex using medications. Their stories are peppered throughout the media, and they are publicly known in the everyday world as ""transgender"".But what about the 95% of people who never choose to ""transition""?Lin Xiaorui (???), a second-generation Chinese university student with Japanese heritage, never wanted to be transgender. Even though he instinctively knew from a young age that he never fit in with the other boys and secretly desired to have been born a girl, he never dared to mention it to his conservative traditional family.Lin Xiaorui is also a realist. Even as a teenager, it was more than apparent to him how hard life would be if he made a certain taboo choice that everyone shunned. It would be hard to get a job, hard to pay bills, hard to face his family, hard to make friends, and just as hard to find love. The world as it stands remains filled with discrimination against ""apache helicopters"". Lin Xiaorui wasn't brave enough to commit himself to a life of constant hardship and struggles. A quiet peaceful life was all that he desired, and Lin Xiaorui never thought of himself as a particularly daring or brave person. He's been a quiet, studious, and withdrawn straight-A student all his life after all.Despite how badly his heart yearned for it, every part of his brain screamed that it was a bad idea to become transgender. It wasn't a rational choice. In fact, it seemed like a horrible one in the grand picture of things.This was why Lin Xiaorui never wanted to be transgender.Lin Xiaorui resolved himself a long time ago to simply be a man.Until one day he woke up and discovered that a tanabata wish that he had frivolously written over nine years ago at a shrine unexpectedly came true -- though, not quite exactly in the way that he (she?) expected.

In a faraway land full of magic, there lived a beautiful young maiden (well, as beautiful as the most average high schooler can get) who, because of a powerful spell cast by an evil witch was cursed to fall into a deep sleep until her prince comes to deliver true love's kiss.

19514,The Astral is Alive,"The essential question explored in this novel, set in the backdrop of one corner of the Known Worlds, concerns responsibility--namely, unavoidable and divine responsibility for others and the direction of society. What does one do, and how does one act under the brunt of ultimate expectation? When one is expected to stop wars, bring peace, and choose the winners and loser of history, how would they operate? How should they operate?
The character of the Astral was designed to inhabit and navigate that space by tackling sets of episodic obstacles thrown at him chapter-by-chapter. He inherits a broken, chaotic world that expects him to order and renew it into the future, yet is given very few tools by which to make that divine mandate a reality. And so, as we are all called to do, he sets out on his homeworld of Arow to make his own way and discover what being the Astral really entails.
This novel is the culmination of many things. It represents seven year's work and a lifetime of consideration. While designed as a whimsical and entertaining narrative, it's also intended to be an anthem to my life and to those ideas that both captivate and inspire me--and in the end, a vehicle by which to share them.
This novel is a completed work for sale through Amazon. If you enjoy these first few chapters, consider making a purchase at https://www.royalroad.com/amazon/B07FBSTMCN

Our protagonist, Jesse, is trying to survive the apocalypse. Woohoo, let's all root for her. She has a bit of a weird mind; her body's got scars all over it, and let's not spoil anymore about who she is; let's just say she's been through some stuff.
She doesn't know it yet, but she has a year and a day to somehow make her planet safe, or safeish, and I don't know about you, but monsters everywhere are not conducive to safety.
With her intellect, sheer grit, and somehow or another a huge helping of luck, both good and bad, here's hoping she can make it, because if not, well, I don't want to spoil the surprise.
This book will have some basic tags from the beginning: adventure, action, mystery, horror, etc. Others will be added as needed in the future as things start expanding.
This is my first book. I am a native English speaker...sorta. Do give me some constructive criticism; it shows you care.
My final goal with this book is to write an amazing series and an amazing story about the journey of Jesse and the other characters and to show character growth and overall just entertain you. Because sometimes reality stinks, so a good book and a reading nook with some snacks, a lamp, and a blanket, and you're happy for life.
This book is first person for the first Arc, so about the first 10 or so chapters after that it moves to a third person unreliable with a smattering of first person point of views. I like the unreliable narrator and think it is interesting as a story device. The reason being you yourself have to think a little to figure out what's truth and what's not and how each of what I say in the mystery reveals itself as a bigger unfolding of events, little by little.
Overall, it's a good book, is what I hope my ratings, comments, and reviews say. Do all of those, yeah. Wouldn't you want to be encouraged if what you're doing is awesome or not? I do, so please speak up; your voice matters.
1 chapter on Saturday every week. Might get 2 if work is lighter.
Ps. Era of Mist is only on Royal Road Legends. Please tell me if it shows up elsewhere. Thank you.

I'm writing this story as a hobby while doing uni so the length between updates may vary from a couple of days to a couple of months so don't think Im dead or have abandon the story if I havent updated in awhile, I will let you know if either of them have occured.

With the countless possible combinations of Levels, Skills and Jobs available, there is no telling who or what might leave its mark on the pages of history.

Legends of Gods who shaped the world to fit their vision, and great demons that sough to wreck it for their own amusement.
This, however, is not one of those tales.
This is the story of a man who finds a cat in a box.

[Hey guys, author here! The story will be updated regularly (to the best of my ability). The Cover Illustration is from the Pintrest of cobaltplasma, in case anyone was wondering.

19768,Vampire Lord Lorik,"I do not own the cover of this novel I found it on google if you are the owner please tell me I will give you credit in the description, Thank You.
I will be releasing a chapter for this novel every Monday.
In a world much like our own, there are monsters in the shadows such as Vampire, Werewolves, Ghouls, and many more and they have been in hiding for nearly 10,000 years
but due to an arrogant and warmongering Werewolf known as Renkas who thought they should be top of the food chain started a war against The Humans at first they were winning but due to the humans ingenuity they found that the monster's weakness is silver and the course of the war changed in one night and after a hard-fought 13 years Humanity won the war over the werewolves but they didn't stop there.
knowing there are monsters lurking in the shadows Humanity founded a private military group known as The Venatores which is Latin for The Hunters.
Over the past 27 years all around the world, The Venatores have been eradicating anything they think is a monster even monsters that if encountered would never harm someone such as fairies and gnomes but The Venatores don't care.
The Vampires are near extinction with barely 100 or so left all over the world and most of them are younglings barely 100 years old but there are still 3 Ancients left in the world.
First, there is Lord Zano he is roughly 1200 years old he built a monster city known as Sanctuary he is a peace-loving man but that wasn't always the case as 300 years ago he ripped apart an entire city of humans by himself when he found out they killed a baby ghoul that wasn't even a day old.
Second, there is Lord Remidor he is roughly 800 years old and is the Head of Security at Sanctuary and is a good friend and advisor to Lord Zano the reason being is 48 years ago, Lord Zano saved him from The Venatores and since then he has vowed to spend 200 years repaying him.
Lastly, there is Lord Lorik who is the oldest monster in the world as he is roughly 7,800 years old and over his time he has made one thing painfully clear, he is not good nor evil he does what he wants when he wants and no one can stop him and even the Venatores have decided to leave him alone until they have the means to deal with him.

Yet it seems that death was not his destiny. 
Isn’t it great? I found myself in a new world full of magic, monsters and mystery, surrounded by people I love. Having been summoned by a kind old sorcerer to live my life in peace and happiness. I am enjoying myself immensely. 
No, joke a side. It feels like I have jumped from a slight problem right down to cluster-fuck with no stops in between. My soul feels still raw from having been high-jacked right before I could enter heaven and don’t let me talk about all the other things that have- and still are making my new life a damn roller-coaster. But not the kind where one enjoys the ride. No, the one where the builders had stopped after having finished the first half of the loop…
So, yes, please join me! Having some more bodies will cushion the fall, and who knows, maybe I will survive.
Be not surprised. Most of the time I am pragmatic, strategical and efficient, only sometimes I need a short break to let off some steam. 
topics: journey to another world, magical school ark, adventures, some detective work (not sure how much yet), battle and a lot more
There are multiple POVs, but the idea is to only use one real POV and smaller others to complement. This will not be a multiple storyline novel.

I'm just writing this for fun, but i'll never drop it. This won't be something short, as I have the very long term in mind, but I'm a total noob to writing, so I most likely won't release chapters very often, at least until I really get the hang of it. But, the chapters will always be several thousand words long. At the minimum 2k, maximum like 6k... Pretty big variations, sorry.
If you like it, great. If you don't, that's understandable. Regardless, if you have a read, I'd appreciate feedback for areas you think I should improve on, whether it's the use of some words or how I should write something or WHATEVER. I'm open to anything, good or bad, because with your help, it'll help make this story better.
**DISCLAIMER**
So you don't waste your time, I want to let you know what you're getting into, because I like knowing ahead of time before I read something.
This might appear like a Xianxia novel, but it's not. It only starts that way. This is a western fantasy world and setting that many of you are familiar with.
The beginning chapters might be a bit of an info dump. Some of it might seems superfluous, but a lot of information is relevant to the story. The first few chapters might also seem rushed, but I'll try to keep it exclusive to those.
This is a cliche, OP MC story with the typical harem, but other than the quick start, everything else will be gradual. There will be romance, and probably many moments at that, but don't expect anything TOO detailed. If you want something really steamy, look elsewhere.
References and throwbacks to stuff most likely.
The setting won't be really dark or really light. Middleground, I guess. The MC is far from a young kid, but he won't totally reflect his age.
I don't plan on discarding info, abilities or characters that you KNOW should come back and be around. I see it a lot and it sort of bugs me haha... but I could have oversights, I dunno. As I said, I'm a noob.
That's it, really. If you're interested, welcome to my world!",250
19783,Yuri Dungeon [Discontinued],"Goddess Dungeon Master Zellana installed fear throughout Tiapra. Working with the [Demon King] and his cohorts, they plagued mankind with their forces. With Goddess Zellana by his side, they never lost their lands to the advancing humans. Zellana's dungeon was a lot of things. A prison, a torture chamber, an arms factory, a training yard, a monster facility, an academy- it was a lot of things. It served to be one of the greatest dungeons in the world.
 
But due to the peace between demons and mankind, Goddess Zellana got bored of the peace and Tiapra. Unable to cope with this era, she traveled through various realms and worlds, exploring the mysteries and wonders of these other dimensions. 
 
Two thousand years later, she returns home, longing to see her kind again, missing Tiapra.
 
But sadly, cause of her disappearance, time has changed. And her dungeon has been forgotten. Correction: It's in ruins.
 
Watch this former Goddess remake her dungeon into something that is completely different from its former glory. Abandoning any means of servitude, she will show everyone what she really wanted to do.
 
Hint: If you know your Japanese, the first word of the title should give it away 
 
Warning: 18+ Will be heavy on the lesbomancy.
 
Edit: I guess I should also place this sort of warning down here because even if I am writing this for the heck of it, there will be scenes/implications/recurring actions of rape. It may be silly, at first, but when it comes down to it, it is, technically, the MC doing whatever the heck she wants and enforcing her views and actions onto another being unwillingly or against their will. So if you did not read this, you miss the warning label.",78
19784,Princess Dragonslayer,"It's an old, old story.  Princess is in a tower, guarded by a dragon.  Prince slays the dragon and rescues her. Said Prince is then awarded the Princess and half of her kingdom.
Arriane is having absolutely none of that.
She takes fate into her own hands and forges a path of her own.  But in a world where stories are practically alive, she's going to learn that all choices have consequences.
What you can expect:
This is a more “traditional” fantasy writing.  There’s no game system, numbers, or levels.
Hopefully: Good writing, humor, interesting characters, and subverted (or avoided) tropes.  LGBTQ themes will be present.
I have around 50,000 words written currently.  My motivation to write tends to come from feedback - if you like the story, please tell me!  If you like parts and dislike other parts, please tell me! Hate the story? Please tell me why.
I will be posting a couple of chapters initially, and then at least weekly until I run out of content (based on the remaining story I am expecting this to go around 100k-120k words for Book 1).  Chapters are in the 4k-6k word count range. If I get a good response, I may write more and post extra chapters.
Tags:
Gender Bender: No “true” gender swaps, but crossdressing and gender role mixups.  This is not used for titillation - it’s important to the plot.
Multiple Lead Characters: With some exceptions chapters will alternate between the FL (Princess) and ML (Prince).
Profanity: Present but not excessive (one character may not obey this because they are an asshole like that).
Sexual Content: Fade-to-black.  Nothing explicit.
Gore: Fighting scenes but not overly descriptive.
Traumatising Content: Rare, but there will be occasional scenes that fit this warning so I wanted to call it out.",31

Disclaimer
This story is:
1) Extremely violent and graphic.
2) Still in a rough draft stage.  I see what I am writing more like a synopsis than a fully fledged story.  I periodically will go back to flesh out earlier chapters, build characters, etc... If you find the words ""Show don't tell,"" comforting accept that unfortunately, I'm not at that stage of the writing process yet.
3) At one point this story was called ""Standard Reincarnation Story,"" and I had written an extremely off-putting description of the story. This was mostly to keep out people who would just read the silly first few chapters then rage quit as soon as the violent stuff got started.  Since I just had my first .5 star rating (without a page read count increase) that technique is not working, so I might as well treat this as a regular fiction and try to get regular readers.","2,406"

These were just some of the questions i would ask myself on daily basis, well rather than to ask myself questions about it. I dreamt about it, I wished for it and i begged for it, but to no avail.

I have arrived in another world and become Guanyin Boddhisattva, a guy who looks like a woman with endless passion for all.
When I was still in the 21st century, I wondered if Guanyin had a dick. After I have become him, I look down and check it...... Oh, I do have a dick.
I used to think I can help every living being getting out from all sufferings, until Buddha says to me: 'Now that naughty child Sun Wukong is your responsibility.' After that, my daily has become clearing up the mess done by Buddha, done by that monkey Sun, done by Jade Emperor, and done by other boddhisattvas. It is hard to earn payment as a boddhisattva these years.
As the Goddess of Mercy Guanyin with tens of millions of followers, I am busy with dressing myself like a woman to get back their monk robe from the evils, transforming into a woman to test their sensations, enlightening them as a woman since then......
From Lingbo Fairy, to an eighty-ish old woman, I have tranformed into every possible woman forms I know.
If I have one day free from Sun Wukong's bothering, I will be impressed and cry and light three insences for myself in one of my temples.
PS: All Buddhists will not have a lover.

19849,Trashy story ! v1.5,"Author:
I've made alot of mistakes in my plot,
I've relied on force to do it naught.
Where does quality go?
When you give up patience for speed though?
 
 
This is a story I will begin,
Hopefully this will make your hearts sing!
There's not much I do that is right,
But I will enjoy writing it this night.
 
So those of you who will cheer me on,
Or not i'll be happy to sing you a song!
 
A song in text! 
Wish me luck next! - authors (singular)  
Trashy story v1.5: starto! 
 
Serious synopsis: Hey everyone it's the author here (Not my character named ""Author"" or ""Also author"") I'd like to introduce to you my new book ""Trashy story""! So you're proboaly wondering what this ""Trashy story"" is about, well wait no longer I shall tell you! (Or try to sound cool as I tell you nothing.) 
This story will be written entirely in poem style assides from the author notes (Which are in itself a out of character in character commentary of the story.) With this type of format I hope to talk about things which are commonly overlooked in novels, and or things which are blaringly obvious yet often ignored! In the earlier version of this novel I had gone over things such as how the conditions of a fantasy world may force bandits to do what they do, and also the effects of killing a leader will cause! Even if the leader is a tyrant a power vacuum makes life a living hell, and often more of a living hell than before. 
This story was written on qidian as well but I felt like I was rushing too much on the writing (As qidian is use to crazy release rates) so I hope to port it over to here as I rewrite problamatic chapters. Said chapters may be updated on qidian once I find a good foothold to improve the plot again.
Well thankyou for reading this far down on the synopsis, I'm not sure why you've read so far down but thankyou! I hope you will enjoy ""Trashy story"" v1.5 as much as I enjoyed writing it!
""Trashy story"" v1.0 : 46 chapters (24 not counting side storys) 
""Trashy story"" v1.5: rewrite starting at chapter 35 (21 not counting side storys) 
You may be wondering why half of the novels publication so far (as of writing this synopsis) is side story (Bleh... filler!) Well that is because the side stories are where I develop most of the world building. (They really are only called side stories because they follow the side characters and antagonist) 
Note: The origional novel (V.1) can be found on webnovel... Howeverrrrr I will reupload every ""Okay"" chapter up to the breakoff point here as well. Proof of me moving over to royal road (And not shamelessly stealing chapters) can be found in the latest chapter ""Temporary haitus: Partial rewrite"")

19853,Seizing the Light,"Daryl as far as he’s known has always been surrounded by the never-ending darkness. His parents and everyone around him abuse him almost to the brink of death. Then one day he is given an opportunity to break out of the darkness and seize the light for himself. But not before learning that the world doesn’t revolve around him and that the various forces don’t always allow Daryl to do as he wished. 
A story with unique power systems, character progressions. A good story (attempted) reinforced by complex side and main characters. Contains action, adventure, mystery. tragedy, psychological challenges, scheming/mind battles and even a bit of philosophical stuff, romance (don’t read it for the romance..) and horror all in a low fantasy setting",0

19858,Carl's Cosmo,"Carl is a downtrodden, late twenties, depressed man. After an event, he finds himself somewhere else.
 
The title is more to do with the story taking place in Carl's view of the world and what's around him (his Cosmos), than it does with actual space stuff. So don't expect starship or lightsabers.
I'll update the synopsis once I have more than one chapter. I have an idea for the story, but I haven't started writing except for this. I'll probably do a chapter a week until I find a groove to get into. Nothin exciting happens in this first chapter, but it does set the tone for how the novel should feel. Let me know what you all think. Also message me for any grammar/spelling mistakes, I'm trying to do this nifty trick where I read what I wrote before posting it.

Author's Comments:
The story starts off with the MC as a 5 year-old but will progress soon after as I intend to age the characters as it goes along. The story is delivered from multiple charactes viewpoints so you won't have to listen to the mind of a child constantly. I hope you enjoy reading~",2

Updates at random
Romance is not the focus but a major plot point.
I will take suggestions and corrective criticism.

 *Important Note*
This makes for sense as you read along. 
This story is created by the viewer but there is a twist. Some chapters are static, meaning that it is to propel the plot. Others have polls that will affect other chapters but without a question. This means you don't know what it effects or in which chapter. I wanted to added this effect to create a suspense, something I didn't feel as much in other reader interactive stories. Your vote could create fortune or misfortune for the main character. I know what it will effect because have a chart that tells me the possible routes. You just have to wait and see what your choice have done. I'll even write which poll effects the chapter in the authors note. 
Characters could die in the story and they won't be leads anymore.
In comments you can ask for a detail chart for each poll but it will only be for one answer per poll. I will chose the most requested answer.
I do not own the photo.",12
19885,The Server,"Okay before reading please note that this will be a hiatus for a long period of time. Basically, I am just writing the story and fine-tuning the story before I start releasing this on a schedule. My reason being is because as a new writer I was not aware that if you fix something in your little writing people who already read ahead aren't aware. I do plan to release chapters but only at least three months if not more. Sorry!
I also want to send this before anyone starts complaining. This story will be more virtual reality later on, but the start of the book will consist more of survival than actual technology based. 
In a Universe that is ruled by two different races with militaristic dominance, it is oddly peaceful. It's not that odd if you consider the fact that the ruling humanoid races aren't bent on ruling but on expanding everyone’s technology. It is also an enjoyable past time to watch other people struggle in a war with a ton of deceit and savagery. They decided to make ‘The Server’ just to sate both desires. Having already discovered all of the known universes they decided to take everything virtual so no one tries to take over their power to make their own and to ruin their plan to help everyone. Or so they say. After many rules and regulations, a new player is about to enter named Joey Mandale. Being a go lucky adult at the age of eighteen he is given the special class Dungeon Creator. How will he create his own mark on The Server among so many veterans before the restart? How will he survive this trial that has his very life on the balance? Will he try to fight for his own planets rights or will he create his own home and his own territory that none will encroach upon?  
 Note: I plan to do a chapter with around 2000 words per chapter.
If there are any parts in the book that don't match each other please let me know so I can fix them. 
This book I had a hard time considering if it should be a fan fiction. I decided against it because I wasn't copying the world nor the character. The book The Gam3 inspired me to write this as well as many other games I've played and other books I have read. I Loved how the gam3 did a virtual reality game with a blend of a sci-fi. I played a game called stellaris and gave me the idea to implement some of the gameplay like that into The Server. (Title might change in the future.) 
Just wanted that out there. If you're even slightly interested in this check out The Gam3 on royal road because it's really good and similar to this book in how he set up the universe although he did it quite a bit differently.",4
19887,Ore’s Adventure!,"I was your average simple guy with just classes and all those kind of things...

No one knows what causes this to occur, and many theories exist. What is known is that these immortals do not age and do not get sick. It is also clear that they still die as anyone else does through any other factor, and just as easily as any mortal.
They also gain a unique ability for themselves that no one else possesses. Similarities exist to be sure, but the exact details of each ability are unique.
This is the story of one such immortal, one who simply showed up at an academy and registered himself as a student. He calls himself Mitzi.
 
 
Hey guys, this will simply be a story that I will be writing in my spare time. Please do not expect a constant schedule, or any specific lengths for chapters. I will try to keep a minimal quality when it comes to grammar and spelling. I do have an endgoal in mind for this story, but I do not know everything that will happen between the start and the end, only the gist of it.

After having reigned for thousands upon thousands of years, the appearance of the White God and his son, the Saviour himself, pushed humanity to start a war to expunge all supernatural. For fifteen centuries humanity fought and pushed the ""forces of darkness"" into the shadows, and, having banished most magic of any kind, an age of science had been heralded. After spreading Christian culture into many corners of the world, the old gods and myths had been but hearsay, mere tales - even if there were still fervent believers for some religions. Yet, in places unseen, gods and myths still persevered, beaten down, licking their wounds... Preparing to once again return to their glorious olden days.
And now they're finally ready.
In Windfall, Arizona, there is a little store selling antiquities, occult objects and lost-and-found items. The owner, one Ms. Cressinda Edgecombe, also known as the Ethdrahl's Witch, is a fearsome sorceress, who has after surviving the witch hunts decided to retire. Content with her business continuing lazily from day to day, she enjoys her time with alcohol, loud music, long naps and her best friend Agnes Carter, lawyer, party girl and Hindu deity.Which leaves the work for her new part-timer, Aaron Wilson, orphan and former-delinquent and born with the skill to talk with ghosts and spirits. Things don't get any easier for him, when a girl comes out of a sword and decides he is her new owner - which just pushes a series of events along, that he could have really done without...
And caught between all fronts is third-rate wizard Howard Bruckner, who is stuck with Detective Ann Linsner and the nigh-impossible task of keeping her alive - a normal human infected by society's scientific common sense and with the job of investigating supernatural crimes.

As the largest human Empire, the Alyastia Kingdom sought their power to fight the pestering Demons. As a result, these Heroes were praised and hailed as glorious figures in every human town and province alike. From humanity’s perspective, they were merely the “good guys” defeating the barbaric “bad guys.”
However, from a certain person who lived with these Demons, he saw these Heroes as pure monsters.
Growing up and living with Demons and Humans in harmony, his life was pure bliss. A model village for what true integration and love looked like. However, all that shattered when a certain Hero forever took that away. Distraught in sorrow, his life was forever changed. Setting off with eyes focused on revenge, he begins his blood-filled journey as a [Hero Assassin] with one goal in mind.
To forever eliminate all heroes for good.
Only then could he create a world where every race can live in harmony.

However, the gods showed mercy. A young wolf cub, lost and cut off from its mother, stumbled over the young Ollowyn. Half frozen to death and dead tired, it snuggled to the warm body. When it was found by the mother just hours later, Ollowyn already smelled like one of her own. 
Adopted and cared for he grew up among wolves. He learned to live after the rules of the pack, continuously fighting to survive. As the years went by, he grew stronger than his brothers and sisters, hunted with different means. 
But even though he loved and adored his family, he noticed more and more that he was different. No fur, no claws and as much as he tried, his teeth would never find prey by themselves. What made him different? The urge to find answers grew with every day, until he set out aged seven to find them. 
 But after days of searching hunger and exhaustion brought him to his knees as he collapsed on a dusty road.

Author's note.
There is an overarching plot that is more than just the dungeon getting bigger.
I will be uploading at least one chapter a week until furthur updates on my schedule get posted and hopefully more once I finish off the other book i'm working on.
You can expect me to try and craft unique challenges and floors, stuff you most likely haven't seen before in dungeon books whilst still having a hopefully decent plot. I can't promise much about it but I will certainly read all the comments, respond where appropriate and take on board suggestions.
I promise to keep you updated and not drop away without saying anything.
I would consider this to be part of the writers pledge but if circumstances force my hand I may have to drop it. (no plans)
 
A Note on tags:
Profanity: Not excessive but where i find appropriate.
Gore: Well that depends how well I do my job doesn't it. If I can paint a vivid picture that has the potential to be gory, then my writing may be to an acceptable quality.
Traumatising content: Again, this depends on my skill as a writer, I guess I hope you find it traumatising - no that’s not right. Well you know what I mean anyway. Hopefully I can paint a vivid picture in your mind that makes the book all the more special.",635

A lottery was held worldwide, in which fifteen winners would be given the privilege to add a custom-designed player faction to the game, tailored to their desires as best as could be balanced. The tagline for it, was “If it’s balanced, we’ll allow it.” This opened up many avenues for avid writers and gamers alike, all wanting to bring their dreams to life.
In a world where virtual reality and deep dive is still in its infancy, such a large scale project had yet to be seen. And one of these winners, got exactly as he wished for and, unexpectedly, more than he had bargained for.

For two thousand years this has been the truth for the people of Alturine, the holy southern empire. For two thousand years, tradition has been leeched away to form a vicious cycle where the rich stay rich and the poor beget more poverty. Only now, when the southern realms of men are at their lowest does darkness leak back to stake its claim.
Marius was raised in the northernmost reaches of Alturine under the trees of the Black Forest where remnants of the old kingdoms still linger. He never believed the stories of short mountain men, nor the old fables about mages and dragons. Yet the darkness cares little for belief and faith. He watched as wargs tore his mother and sister asunder, as the undead carried his father into their ranks and as his town was put to the torch and drowned in blood. Rage fuelled and vengeful Marius struck out against the architect of his misery only to be outmatched and left for dead.",13

On his way to the facilities Cryo stops at a gas station to get some snacks and the gas station is stuck-up by a robber.

Cryo is then transported to purgatory where a cute goddess decides his fate to be transported to a realm that needed help, promising Cryo if he found 4 legendary swords in this world he would gain re-admittance to the life he once lived. Before being transported to the world that needed assistance the goddess tells him that he can maximize any of his traits, procuring thought into whether Cryo should choose looks, strength, or another trait. After being reminded of his terrible luck in which a flashback to his family dying in a house fire is shown, he decides maximizing his luck trait should be the best choice. He is then transported into this new world, which turns out to be the world of his gacha game, Ultima Online.

20255,The Demon Against the Heavens,"On faraway lands where the Chinese culture meets a Korean nuance, a strange Curse befalls Helial. It may ruin his life entirely, or it may not. From a Korean video-game scenario which follows the Immortality genre design of Chinese fantasy novels, in a world outlined by Classical elements as well, nothing compares the call of freedom.While contrastingly different worlds get in touch volume after volume, this brand-new genre explores new horizons that traditional fantasy literature has never reached before.",309

20257,The Children's Crusade,"Galactic Year, 649.
 It has been long since the fall of earth. Our mother planet has been in ruins for centuries. Humanity is in a full-scale war against the Kyl’aq. Countless men have died in the cold, vast battleground of outer space. However, their blood was not enough to satisfy the devourers. Our growing military strategy and firepower is outmatched. We were unable to keep up with the Kyl’aqi evolution. The thick metallic clouds they spew disabled our machinery and jammed our communications. Their staunch plasma shields rendered most of our weapons utterly useless. Microbial anomalies and acidic fumes put a huge burden on our economy and manpower. However, the nightmare that is most feared by the defenders of man, is none other than the dreaded Atrox. The epitome of the Kyl’aq warring class, the Atrox, evolved an organ that enables biological cold nuclear fission. Powered by this unworldly source of energy, the Atrox unleash fearsome power with unaccountable agility in battle. Several Space fleets were torn like paper by this small human-sized beast.
Anyone who watches the Atrox in battle would despair at the reality upon which we are standing. The fall of humanity is near. The last card humanity drew to fight against the mighty Atrox was a symbol we believed in from the ancient past.
 
The Knights.
 
The weapon they wield, the Knightsword, is made from epoh, the only substance in this universe capable of penetrating the hardened shields of the Atrox. Because epoh is so rare in quantity, it was not forged into bullets or shells, things that would be wasted and forgotten. It was thus cast into a weapon our first ancestors passed down to us – the sword.
Those who receive the sword that are most expensive and precious – more than a thousand cities – who can stand against the mighty Atrox, the living hope of humanity itself, they are the Knights.
Undergoing hundreds of surgeries and augmentations to exceed the limits of man, swapping genes and being injected with neurochemicals, withstanding merciless training that cut bones and reshape organs, and receiving the most rigorous education our race can provide, The Knights are not seen as mere humans but as demigods of our century. However, the demand is far greater than our supply, and the average age of the knights are in the teens. So many young knights are pushed into war and slaughtered before they ever master their swordsmanship.
They are the ones who watch their comrades fall hundreds of times. They are the ones who battle with thousands of foes and finally cross blades with the Atrox.
Our gods are mere children, who shoulder the despair of all a humanity that is struggling to survive.
The praises, money, and worship of our society could not cure these children who are wounded deep within. Young knights endure mere hours and minutes for the months and years of the human race. Their lives are like candles, lit up and consumed by fire for their brothers’ bliss. Yes, they are live sacrifices for our failing world.
May glory be within all fallen Knights. We pray they would find peace at last; the peace they desired so dearly in their lives.",3
20258,A Fox's System,"A small blunder leads to Riku being cruelly killed by a collapsing shrine. The goddess it belonged to leaves him with an easy choice: Being reborn with in a new world or to start his journey to the afterlife.

20272,Fur and Fang,"""A fire burns across our land, it ravages villages and tears families apart. A fire burns across our land boy, just look!"" A man grabs the face of his son and forces his crying visage to stare at the plumes of smoke which scar the night sky and illuminate it with the dim glow of violence. 
He tells his son of how the sea people came, how they took an axe to the realms of the wood folk and split apart the years of relative prosperity they had prospered under.
""We can only quell the flames if we rally boy if we continue to scramble backwards, fighting the fires behind us and picking at old wounds instead of uniting then that is how we will die, desperate and afraid."" His son is crying, he can hear the joyous hooting of the sea people in the distance, coming closer.
""Call the mercenaries boy, tell the woodland kings of what has happened here. Tell them how we suffer and pray to the gods that they answer our call, do you hear me, boy?!"" He grabs the lightly furred face of his son and forces the boy to look him in the eyes.
""Yes, father.""
""Good, now go. Spread the message to all the corners of the woods."" His fathers expression softens and he pushes his son on his way, away from him and further onto the road out of their burning village.
The boy turns around but once as he runs away, he watches as his father charges defiantly into a knot of armoured sea folk, screaming his rage at them and with his knife brandished high above his head.
The boy turns and runs before he sees the outcome, he must tell the kingdom, he must tell them to rally, or divided they will fall.

Author Note:
Hey guys, this story focuses mostly on a single mercenary company and them fighting the onslaught of the sea people, the little scene above just serves to set the stage for the actual characters.
This story was somewhat inspired by the ""Redwall"" book series and if you haven't read those than what I mean by that is basically that instead of the world being inhabited by humans it is instead populated by Ampromorphic woodland creatures such as badgers, mice and hares to name a few.
The story involves elements of High Fantasy and later on kingdom building. One chapter will be posted each and every day.",3

The first character is a child of the Uchiha and the Hyuga clan, something that shouldn't have been as such he has been scorned for his entire life. Taiga Hyuga hopes to change that just as soon as he can become a Genin.
This story is set in the Naruto world built around a couple characters I created, unfortunately this does mean it Isn't able to be a real story just a fan-fic, however I only intend to use this as a way to perfect my writing and if I do well I have a couple ideas for real stories.

Book 2: (Released on Kindle and Amazon)
A year after the events of book 1, Solus is still trying to find a way to restore his status window. Straying deeper into the wastes, he searches for his original sphere, hoping that perhaps it can offer him a solution. Instead, he stumbles upon an ancient hidden installation and finds an AI of a different caliber. It might have the knowledge to help him, but is it trustworthy enough?On the return trip, Solus meets a new adversary: a new kind of undead that is almost as powerful as himself. When he finally manages to return to Skulltown, he finds that he isn't the only one that these strange new undead have attacked.As more and more mindless and highly aggressive undead begin to appear, disturbing news arrives from beyond Skulltown. Black rifts are appearing in the wasteland, ejecting both sentient and mindless undead. The only one who may have the solution is also the one least likely to help him: Scathia, the mysterious leader of Silt, the one who awoke Vingria, and the one who seems bent on world domination.
Book 3: (Released on Kindle and Amazon)
Many years have passed when Solus slowly wakes from his slumber. He quickly realizes that his body is still unable to move and might be for a long time. However, events above ground are not waiting for him, and he needs to find a way to interact with the world if he is to save his friends. Meanwhile, Tirella finds multiple massive threads that might spell the end of the fledgling undead world.
All three books have been released on Kindle. Due to this I've had to stub the story here.

20357,Pirate Cove [Coming Soon],"Humanity is trapped. Too late did the politicians and the people discover that it was a grave mistake to ignore all of the academia screaming at them that climate change was real. By the time everyone had been convinced, it was too late. Humanity was set on a path of destruction that couldn't be fixed. In desperation, they turned to the stars. A project was started, funded by all of the major governments, with one purpose. Find a way for humanity to leave Earth and survive in space. The project was ground to a halt when they realized there was no way to actually leave the planet. Years of rocket launches had created a cloud of debris, floating around the Earth. Any spacecraft launched was met with an impenetrable wall. They were trapped.
While the project was a failure, it made significant scientific and technological breakthroughs. The world united, desperately searching for a way to live.
Pirate Cove follows a group of college kids as they struggle to face their reality, and try to escape it through the VR game, Pirate Cove. Also, I haven't tried to write a drama before so this will be a new experience. Constructive criticism is welcome.

20373,Primacy Online,"Life on Earth was nearly eradicated in World War III, but using alien technology, the Patriarch of the Church of the Resurrection built a new society from the ashes. He created what he called the Constructed Reality MMORPG, Primacy Online, a world so real that the players could not distinguish it from reality. After outlawing wars between the city-states on Earth, he declared that all wars would be fought inside the world of Primacy Online.
Thirteen hundred years later, the release of Primacy Online VI: Legacy of Balor signals the beginning of World War IX. Players from Earth's city-states will be locked in cryogenic capsules and play Primacy Online in War Mode. Their achievements in the game will determine the victory rankings of their city-states, but if they die in the game, they will die for real.
Patrick Armagh found flaws in the game mechanics of Primacy Online and exploited them to rise to the peak of the game. But when the Church declared he was cheating, he was perma-banned from the game. Now, the Church has declared that Patrick and all the other perma-banned cheaters will be included in a special Church group for World War IX, where they can earn redemption for their sin of cheating. However, Morgan Danan, Speaker of the City of Mann, and the generally acknowledged number one player of Primacy Online, has a deal for Patrick. With her help and his method of cheating, he has the chance to become a virtual god within Primacy Online, but by taking up her offer, he will become an enemy of the Church.
Like a significant percentage of Primacy Online players, Patrick suffers from an ultimately fatal, degenerative nervous system disorder. He has less than five years to live. With death staring him in the face and nothing to live for, he accepts Morgan Danan's offer, and once again, enters Primacy Online as Crom Cruach, a disgraced legend.

Centuries later, the primordial currents of space instead pulled this craft back to Earth, descending as a fallen star bearing the fruit of human advancement whose seed had been planted there.

Author's note: This is actually the first volume of a novel I wrote nearly a decade ago for the VNDB discussion boards, taking inspiration from the random off-topic ramblings that characterized the golden age of the community. After sevear years and countless rewrites, it is pretty much unrecognizable, but while it is not fit for professional publishing (due to the fact that several fragments and older versions are still out there on various forums and blogs), I decided it is a waste to just let it sit idly on my hard drive forever.

Now, with that glowing review, I happily present a post apocalypse sci fi short story.  It should have some fun tech ideas and decent action scenes along the way.  Dunno if it really counts as grimdark, but its not exactly pleasant happy times either.  I do hope you guys enjoy some of it, but also please feel free to make fun of it, that's the point of posting it here.  I do regularly, its quite cathartic.  :)",0

The release schedule is currently whenever I finish a chapter. It could be a week, it could be tomorrow. I currently work two jobs and until writing pays the bills, this is the best I can offer. So until I get some significant chapters stored up here I will beg for your patience. Thank you.While I am working on other stories, this story will contain most of my pop-culture, movie, Japanese and fantasy genre references. If you don't get a reference, I encourage readers to ask questions in the comments so everyone can be enlightened and join in my madness. I will also be letting my political opinions creep into the story when we get to later chapters. If you disagree with me politically I would ask you to be curtious in your comments and keep your discourse civil.This story will contain some few chapters of explicit, sexual material, each chapter clearly marked when they arrive and I will overall not have much of a filter for my deviant mind in the body of the work as a whole.

20494,ZERO SUM,"""They say that we are lucky to be here. They say that we are free. I have not felt free for a long time.""-AVERY CARRISON, 26, REGISTERED EXPRESSIONIST WRIGHT
One hundred years ago, the water began to rise.
Amstead, a beautiful country along the coast, began to lose ground to the ocean. It overtook land bridges, made islands of peninsulas, lakes of agricultural land. It was the punishment of a people who, despite all warnings, proceeded like the inevitable future would never come. Instead of adapting to the rising tides, Amstead sought higher ground. They laid seiges and bombs against their northern neighbors, quickly overtaking those countries too small too resist.
Our story takes place in Port Haven, a city built on the bones of Pravya, the Ossan port city that Amstead destroyed. In pursuit of a new home, the seat of Amstead's government has shifted from its drowning home to beautiful Port Haven. Port Haven, like all cities across the globe, is powered by Wrights-a person utilizing supernatural forces to practice magic.
For centuries since their discovery in the world, Wrights have been persecuted for fear of their power. Humans have learned to harness Wright utility to accomplish great tasks. Running water, electricity, agriculture, any and all forms of modern innovation and convenience are powered by Wright utility, either directly manipulated by a tasked Wright or run off the storage of their energies. Wright blood has even been utilized to create an addictive recreational drug called Glow that is widely used by Wrights and humans alike.
Amstead glorifies the knowledge of the Expressionists, Wrights who utilize their knowledge and talents to bend the very laws of science. She uses and subjugates Adjuncts, common Wrights who manipulate naturally occurring elements. She actively seeks to eliminate Bloodwrights, Wrights who are inclined to control and manipulate body systems.

Anathema and You
 
The first documented case of Anathema was in 1692. The church classified it a plague when the protestants decided that the symptoms of Anathema were unholy, and those afflicted must be exterminated. After a small town massacre in Massachusetts in which 20 lives were claimed, the rest of the world quickly adopted the crusade against Anathema. 
 
Colloquially, Anathema is referred to simply as a curse. Up until the turn of the 20th century, being infected with Anathema was punishable by death. However, after a United Nations ruling in 976, the cursed were declared separate but equal.
 
Today the cursed are welcome to live a full and normal life so long as they report their condition to the proper authorities and do not exacerbate their symptoms. Whereas most cursed citizens follow this law, there are underground cults and societies whose sole purpose is to rebel against what they believe is unconstitutional oppression. These felons are wanted in all 50 states.
 
If you think you may have Anathema please book an appointment with one of your local clinics. Anathema medical evaluations are provided free by the federal government in every U.S. state, territory and province. All clinics have support and outreach programs, as well as resources for the afflicted and their families. If you are considering suicide please call 1-800-273-8255.
 
 If you or someone you know is considering exacerbating their symptoms, please notify the local authorities immediately.
 
You are not alone, and God Bless America.",3

The story focuses less on dungeon building than on the why of dungeons and how they fit into the universal order.
While I am working from a grand plot, the writing is going slice of life style because I need to do that to work out how things progress into that grand plot.
The original story seed idea / synopsis is below.

The Grand Tapestry protects Rhofhir from Primal Chaos by imposing Order via patterns. However, the patterns grow stiff, stagnant, and so the Tapestry is nearing a time of Unraveling. Evidence of past civilizations wiped out during previous Unravelings foreshadow the apocalyptic catastrophe looming over the world. The mages of the Arcane Asylum reach out across dimensions, searching for some way to prevent, or at least stall, the coming Unraveling. Among the many voices they find is a gifted graduate student researching machine-assisted telepathy -- and his gaming group.
Lena never expected that the chance to play DnD with telepathy would result in her becoming an actual Dungeon Master, nor that her friends could become the bosses of her dungeon. This is, in many ways, her dream come true, but there's a catch: What happened to Brad, the creator of that telepathy machine?",253

Laftus was a bored king. He had the intellect, strength, and resources to carve out his own empire, but preparations for anything successful would only complete in the far future. While he did enjoy his otherwise easy-going and decadent life style, he wouldn't spare resources to bring a hammer down on insurgents.

English is my first language but I pretty much suck at it.
This novel will have sexual content but as someone who can’t stand reading those grocery store romance novels I will likely do as Robert Jorden and just say “they did it” and end it with a fade out scene.
I lied, there will now be grocery store romance novels levels of sex scenes. I will however mark those chapters with “Eros”. Eros as in one of the Greek gods of love making. Feel free to skip those chapters and pretend that it was a fade out sex scene.
And finally, this is not a Star Wars Fan Fiction. The origin of the MC’s name will be explained as the story progresses. Skywalker is just such an awesome name I couldn’t help it. Anyways, we all know Star Gate comes in first followed by Star Track and then Star Wars.

Nothing wrong with those stories this just isn't one. This is a simple story about a guy playing a game and finally 3.)

...This is an experiment at writing a brief exaggeration of some tropes that I see often used in stories like these.
I like the litRPG/ Isekai genre, but some things I read make me cringe, and I hope my first attempt at writing a brief parody on this whole thing makes you cringe this time. ;3
I don't know how much I'll extend this, but I expect it to have about 2-4 chapters. Though, we'll see. Maybe I'll end up turning it into an epic tale of thousands of chapters? ...eh, unlikely. I'll just write on it until I get bored.

20812,A Titan's Crusade,"Erik Thayne spent most of his life being brutally ridiculed and tormented for his weight and physical appearance, among other things. A social pariah and diagnosed with an eating disorder no one has an explanation or treatment for, Erik spent years trying to overcome his issues with his personal image and escape the ridicule and vicious torment of his peers. After years of dedicated effort, and a fresh start in a town away from his childhood and adolescent tormentors, he had finally begun to truly realize what he'd been striving for all along. Only, fate apparently has other plans because in the blink of an eye, Erik found himself snatched from Earth and taken to another universe, another world, where he is offered the chance to be more than he'd ever imagined.
Now, he has to fight to restore the Balance between Chaos and Order on a world of swords and magic, in a universe governed by the System's laws, which resemble those of RPGs from Earth. Erik learned to embrace the things about himself that others taught him to hate, using them to reforge his physical identity into something more removed from his old self-loathing. But can he learn to embrace the darkest parts of his mind just as he did the reviled aspects of his body and become who he needs to be to succeed in the task set before him? It might just prove easier to stalk in the dark as a monster than to walk in the light as a man...
*This is my first time publishing anything I've written to a public audience. Due to formatting issues, I forwent traditional stat-screens for something a little less problematic, delineating stat screens by separating them from regular text with horizontal lines in a lighter-grey coloration. Let me know if you like them or not.
 Criticism is entirely welcome, but please don't hate on my work after only reading 1 chapter. This is a writing project I intend to complete but I have committment problems so we'll see how long this goes on. Also, fair warning, as the description implies, the main protagonist is intended to be someone who has been treated cruelly, developed antisocial tendencies, and ultimately has to question his own humanity--or lack thereof.
This story is not intended to be brutally dark but I will definitely be trying to follow a darker theme. It is intended to be violent and some scenes later in the story might be...alarming. There will likely also be some light, non-graphic (think more implied with crude jokes and conversation than actual details, there will be no full-blown sex scenes)relationship scenes planned later and if you're opposed to either a bisexual or gay main character, stay away. I haven't yet decided which way he's going to swing but the odds on him being straight are relatively miniscule, and I've always wanted to write a story about a gay man who basically looks like a lumberjack because who doesn't like giving conventional stereo-types the middle finger? This will NOT be a harem story, and I have no intention to focus on romance over action--it's a consequence of character development where I'm concerned, not the be-all-end-all of the story.

Yeah. It’s even trashier than it sounds. Don’t judge me, it was a gift from a friend.
*cough* Anyway, this situation wouldn’t be too bad, except I ended up in the body of the worst possible person: the villainess’ older brother. Alexander has great looks, near limitless wealth, and a thoroughly rotten personality. In most of the game’s endings I end up dead or exiled. My family also falls to ruin, and don’t even get me started on what happens to my evil little sister.
Well, whatever. If that’s the hand fate dealt me, then I just have to prevent the bad ends, right? And if I have no choice but to deal with this family’s baggage, I may as well enjoy myself while I’m at it. Being filthy rich and powerful has its benefits.

With the release of the full immersion, the game would not allow for a much more variable gameplay where players are able to do things that they were unable to do previously. The game now, though still having some few systematic mechanics, is now more of an open world where players are able to do things that are only limited by the creativity and imagination.

Author's note: I love the idea of kingdom-building novels and think the genre has a lot to offer, but I don't think many authors do them very well. Here is my attempt. The novel has a strong focus on politics and kingdom building, with occasional action and a bit of humor. Have fun.

Hello hello. This is my first ever 'writing'. Honestly, I am a fickle and LAZY person so I'm not sure if this will ever be completed. But I will try my best since I doubt this will be a long series. So let's hope I persist till its done. I'm not a writer so this will have infrequent updates. This is based on my love-hate relationship with tragic stories and something I've dreamt about before.

Stranded in a magical land beyond the reaches of the universe, The Weather Vane follows our crew of heroes as they try to piece things back together even while The Dark Lord’s forces march, maraud, and murder at every turn.

Once upon a time, I was asked, 'What is your deepest wish?' I thought about it for a long time before I answered.
