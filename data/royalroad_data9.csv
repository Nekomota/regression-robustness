This novel is a sort of, legacy. I wanted to at least put it out there before I passed away due to a combination of financial difficulty, homelessness, job loss, and my last interview taking up the last of my savings (which I did not get the job). If by some miracle, and I get a job that can give me a pay advance by next week (4/8) and I survive this turbulent time, I will edit this - and the formating of the book). If you are so willing, please donate on my patreon page.

24017,Eldritch overlord,"In the year 2094, the DMMORPG Andorra online was released to the world and dominated the gaming scene for decades and showed just what could be achieved in VR.
In Andorra, a person could be anything they wished, from a cyborg to a fucking bunny if they wanted you were allowed access to all races they could think of except for a select few. Now for all of what Andorra accomplished this story is not about Andorra, it's about a player that went by the monicker of daiko.
Daiko was your average salaryman that didn't accomplish much in life so he sought an escape. Wich he found in games and Andorra allowed him to escape and more. Okay, I was lying slightly. Daiko was not your average salaryman he Hated humanity. Now, you're probably asking why he hates humanity well It's quite simple really. He was abused by his parents and all of his so-called friends just used him and the only ones that card were his pets so he loved them with his entire heart until his dad shot them anyway.
So as far as the world was concerned everything that humans touched was destroyed and he wanted nothing to do with them. Andorra was another chance, another life that wasn't absolute shit. Well, as it turns out that heteromorphic characters aren't looked at positively and well he didn't want to play as a human so he persevered until he rose through the ranks and reached the upper echelons of the game.

==============================Wordpress
This webnovel is written for fun, and everything posted is essentially a first draft. Beware of typos and lack of creative descriptions — my main priority is to get the story out over writing quality. Still, I hope you enjoy the story.
Updates are sporadic, but I aim to release a chapter (~2000-3000 words) at least once a week. Average release time is 1 chapter/3 days.
I took inspiration from the lore of the MMO, Dungeon Fighter Online (Dungeon & Fighter), and there may be easter eggs or references to the game, but the story and characters have become wholly original and standalone.

24027,The Anomalies,"There are things in this world unable to be explained by science and common logic. Some call it magic, some call it miracles, others, anomalies. Many people live and die without ever knowing or encountering one. Some met one somewhere in their life and never again. A few people dabble in it in their daily life. While a select few was ridden with it since birth, shaping their life into one twisted story.
This story follows one such man, as the anomalies brought him further and further down to the abyss of hell, and a woman whose whole life revolves around mastering anomalies and monitoring people who have contacts with them.

24029,Dungeonverse,"In the multiverse, the gods and all the other beings who rule have become frustrated and annoyed by all of the bad souls who always vandalises and destroys what they have built. After many years of discussion, they decided to just throw them out of sight, where they can't annoy them any longer.
The place these poor souls are sent to, is a universe ruled by a dungeon. A dungeon, given the purpose of keeping an eye on and distracting these unruly beings. Like rats, they can't escape the dungeon, their only salvation from full insanity being the dungeons challenges, made for its own enjoyment.

The mc will be the dungeon, as it creates planets and challenges for its inhabitants. This is a bit inspired from the novel ""Earth's first dungeon"" here on rrl, as i liked how there were a lot of different instances/dimensions with different themes, and a lot of paths for adventurers to explore. A bit like the concept of putting worlds inside worlds.

Basically, he is reborn, with his knowledge as a scientist of the galactic era, into a new world with magic and aura powers. In this world, humans are part of the 7 major races, but two (or three) are planning to enslave them, while the others are watching on the sidelines. His plans are to develop modern weapons to strengthen the human nation because the mages and aura users aren't immortal or have steel flesh even as they get more power to the point they can deal damage of a howitzer using special moves. Though it doesn't mean that there aren't magical armours (and other things)...  



 


Extra: I'm not sure if romance will be in this. Depends on whether you, the readers, would like it or how I develop the story further. And there won't be an exact release schedule as I prefer my pace of writing and because I'm busy in life (school and extra activities, FML). If you find any mistakes, please remind me. Also, my writing style and the pace of the story may be slower than other stories you might have read on this website. Though I may make some revisions with the story, considering my editor's thoughts.
Also, my story has some concepts from RTW in terms of the idea of creating weapons in a magical world, however, the plot is mine. After reading, tell me, what do you think of the beginning? What do you think your rating would be.?If possible, comment down below anything that could help me improve or to express your thoughts. Lastly, please NO COPY AND PASTE!",15

I eventually decided to put this out there in the hope that somebody more talented and with more time will pick up my idea and make something out of it. So, if you like the idea of it feel free to pick it up. Scrap whatever I wrote or continue with it however you like. Just shoot me a message so that I get a chance to read what you made out of it.And in the unlikely case something ever gets published then just gift me a copy of the book(s) and a coffee.
I knowingly decided to not pick Tags as this is just an introduction or a short-story at best. But in general I envisioned a Grimdark & (High) Fantasy setting with a focus on Mythology.

I had no idea where I was either, as I was extremely disoriented when I eventually woke up. I didn't see my car anywhere, which scared me a bit.
It wasn't until I noticed the sensation of where I am... to where I once was. I panicked harshly when the world looked different to what I thought I was used to. I found myself making friends with some local school girls.
They felt familiar, just like the world, but I had no idea who they were. All I could do was trust them, thinking that I'm a part of this world now.

Many humans and other mystical creatures have been suffering by the uprising of this terrorist group.
A smart guy named, 'Rukito' is caught up in all of this; he gets targeted by one of the members to die, since his parents are one of the wealthiest people in Greenterra, and one of the few that know how to work and develop magic. While this is all happening, a new member is adopted into his family, a mysterious girl named 'Kasai' that is distant and reserved is now living with him in this colossal mansion, making matters even worse.

While being kidnapped is bad enough, the fact that this fairy brat is telling them to kill each other is definitely worse. Apparently, murdering one of your fellow victims is the only way to get out of this luxurious mansion. 
But nobody would do that...right?

Cornucopia of Hope is a non-canon killing game completely alienated from the the canon universe of the Danganronpa games. The things borrowed from the games are as followed: Hope's Peak Academy, and the structure of 16ish hyper-skilled teenagers trapped in an enclosed space and being subjected to a motive, a murder, an investigation, a trial, and an execution of the presumed killer. There are no spoilers, tie ins, or previous knowledge required of the series to read this story!",1

People with powers exist. They live among us. And shockingly the government and the population at large have noticed this. And each are exploiting this fact to the greatest extent that they can. People with powers do not dominate the world but instead become just another cog in the capitalist machinary powering their world. 
More specifically, follow along as a group of university kids utterly fail to save the world and only manage to save themselves from self inflicted sitations through the exceedingly rare combination of plot armour and plot armour.",2
24134,The Royal Toad,"Appearances can be deceiving. But many don't understand this and so assume things based on appearances, only to be made an ass of. This is the story of a being who based their whole life on that idea, on breaking these assumptions as much as possible. This is the story of a being that many of royalty would consider a monster, becoming one of them. This is the story of The Royal Toad.",1
24135,Return From Fantasia,"For 20 years I lived in Fantasia. I arrived unwillingly by slipping through a crack in space. I survived. I arrived to this hellhole and survived.
After 20 long years, I returned.

However, in the beginning of his high school life, he was disturbed by a strange exchange student; a QiLin named Dianthe became his deskmate, bringing him a completely different life.
With the opening of the hidden door of different spaces over the world, mythological creatures from different worlds flock in. In order to deal with these mythological creatures, the human government has introduced the Mythological Biological Communication Method to ensure world peace between human beings and mythological creatures.
Like Husky's silly Anubis werewolf, the devil who likes to do good, an Immortal bird who always walks away from himself, the princess of the sea demon who sings seriously out of tune...
Mythological creatures have come into his life and brought him a new life. When Western Americans meet mythological creatures, what kind of sparks will they explode?

My first story, not sure how it will turn out and where to take it, so it will probably be a train wreck. I take in criticism so bash me as much as you like, just try to make it constructive.

24149,Old Version - The First Magician,"INDEFINITE HIATUS
 
 
I always seem to make these too long when I ask for peoples opinions so I’m not gonna try an exciting description anymore but instead just give you an idea of what to expect. 
First off, this is my 2nd attempt at a story but my foundation for this one is much better than the 1st already and I see this going much further and so far its coming together much faster and easier. 
So please excuse me if things are not up to publishing standards. Also I tend to confuse your, you’re and so on so sorry to people that triggers ahead of time. 
The First Magician follows the story of 15 year old Alex in a post apocalyptic rpg-ish world in the near future. Earth was transformed, monsters appeared and people began being able to use Ki but could not figure out how to use magic. 
Alex ends up becoming the first human able to use magic through a series of events and sets in motion events that will change the very future of the human race. He will be somewhat OP simply because he is the only human (at least to start, who knows about later?) who is able to use mana.
Many classic RPG elements have been removed. I didn’t want the story to be like all of the other lit rpg stories on RRL but it also makes the writing easier for me hence the watering down of rpg elements. 
 
UPDATES: I am doing this to relieve stress and for fun so I will release chapters when I can. So far though ive managed to keep up with 2 most days.
CONTENT WARNINGS: There will be some light language but it won't be insane. I might have some gore later on but am unsure and the same for the sexual content. Sexual content isn't super likely as I doubt I can write it well but I put the tag so people cant yell about it if I add some in the future but forgot to add the tag. 
COVER ART: Yes it is from the anime Log Horizon. It is a good representation of what earth looks like despite it not being many years in the future.

Though they all amble down the same path, the nature of their world will always guide them through different routes. 
Then, what of the man who is both scientist and wizard, he who mastered sorcery, alchemy and the mystic arts? Would he wager everything just because you have everything to wager?
And, the real question is - he who knows everything, he who has everything, he who wagers it all - on what would they even place their stakes.",2
24154,The Legend of Fanaura: Cursed,"'Hey, need some help there?' An unfamiliar voice echoed through her mind, and she startled, losing her grip on the red phial. It rolled through the grass, away from her.
""Oh shoot!"" she yelped, and her focus diverted from her opponent for a split second, but it was enough to prove fatal.
The beast took advantage of her distraction and lunged towards her. She tried to back away, but in her haste, she stumbled and fell. She looked at the beast, inches away from her, and shut her eyes in fear. She raised her arms to cover her head, even if she knew it was futile.
Yet seconds passed, and no pain came.
Then she heard the beast let out a pained yelp. She opened her eyes to the familiar sounds of battle before her. A tall man stood before her, locked in battle with the beast. He wielded a sword as long as his height, yet it didn't seem to hinder him in the slightest. She watched in awe as he swung the obviously heavy sword around as if it were light as a feather. His movements were swift and precise, and it didn't take long before the beast fell to the ground, motionless.
“You alright there, miss?” The man sheathed his sword across his back, before turning to her. Her eyes widened when she heard his voice. It was the same voice who had that had spoken into her mind and the cause of her almost-fatal distraction.
""You...!"" she hissed.***She was the chosen one to end the war between the Goddesses when they were supposed to take care of the world balance. Refused to be the pawn of the Goddess she chooses to kill herself, thinking that it will end her obligation and suffering. But when she woke up in another body, she realized that she can't outrun her fate. Being reborn in the same world after the end of the Goddesses war in a pre-apocalyptic situation, she knew she needs to face her fate as the cursed heroine.

QUOTE FROM TRAILER: ""A tale that was hushed and concealed by the heavens during the final days of the seven warring states of China.

In their trials, they are tested against all that they know and the fine line that once divided mankind disintegrates as camaraderie is found amongst the known enemy.

24178,Fate's Hand,"For a world with no magic, the histories, stories, and beliefs of Earth seem to be filled with magic and wonder. Games used to escape the mundane world often house elements that are simply not part of the real world. Magic isn't real. Monsters are not real. Heroes are not real. But, what if this was not the case? What if all the magic and wonder in Earth's myths, stories, and histories were more honest than they are credited with? What if it was all hidden in a world of its own; hidden behind a carefully guarded veil separating magic and myth from those on Earth? And, if that is the case, why were they separated?
 
These are the questions that lead to the reality of the Hidden World, the place of wonder and magic, and the Veiled World, the mundane and safe place for people to live. Our story follows two young people: Priss Daniels and Terry White. Together they navigate the two worlds, one magic and one mundane, and the problems that continue to bleed across the Veil between them.
 
Priss Daniels is a Mason, an American practitioner of qi that is tasked with the mission of protected the security of Veil and the secrecy of the Hidden World at any cost. Assigned a mission to observe a potentially dangerous mage she finds herself unable to do what is necessary when the truth is revealed to her. Instead she protects her mage from other Masons without him knowing. Priss must navigate two worlds with two identities: one that will protect the balance of the Veil at any cost and one that already failed that mission for love.
 
Terry White is a college dropout that could probably have a better life, but is happy with the one he has. He lives in off the meager earnings from his job at a tabletop games shop and the winnings he gets from the Fate's Hand playing card game tournaments he wins. His girlfriend, Priss Daniels, is the spark to his life that makes everything worthwhile. She may have some secrets related to her family's business he can't know about, secrets that make Priss a rather dangerous person when she wants to be, but that’s alright. As long as she is safe. Terry, though, has some secrets too, secrets that he himself is not aware of, but when they reveal themselves he and Priss may find the fate of more than themselves in their hands.",4

Hi. Soloflyte here. The story falls into the Space Opera genre, one which I wanted to explore. I did notice that there seems to be a lack of pure/original science fiction stories on the site, and I hope the story would encourage readers to try out other science fiction stories.
I do have two active stories as of now on RRL, and because of that, updates to this story would only be on a weekly basis. I'll try to come up with more chapters, but no promises.
ADD. 04.09.17 - This story is also on Patreon, though the Patreon version is usually three chapters ahead. There are also some add-ons not available on the RRL page, specifically ship images and technical data used in the world-building. It's a long story from what I could see from its beginnings.

SYNOPSIS
“THEY SAY THE COSMOS IS A VOID, DISTURBED BY A FEW ISLANDS OF MATTER. THEY’RE WRONG.”– CAPTAIN ELRIC MAIN OF THE LIGHT SECURITY CORVETTE MEDJAY
 
In the far future, mankind's destiny in the stars would be written by corporate interests. After the devastation of Earth's resources by human exploitation and excess, governments proved powerless to repair and reclaim humanity's homeworld. Only giant corporations had the technology and the resources to do what was required. In return, the right to explore and exploit the stars were granted to them by governments already under their control. But cutthroat politics and deadly rivalries continued to remain constant staples of corporate greed.  
The stars now belong to them. And the continued absence of sufficiently advanced lifeforms made the intense competition deadlier and more avaricious. The Milky Way galaxy was but a stepping stone for corporate expansion. Nothing stood in humanity's path. 
An arrogant assumption soon to be shattered.",37
24185,Intercessor,"""In my defense, I hadn't actually been trying to get hit by a truck.""
Artemis wakes up alone in a giant futuristic facility with no hint of where she is, how she got here, or what this means. Yet within two weeks, she is shot at with all the guns, a voice is beginning to speak in her head, and she is tormented by a seemingly sentient and possibly trollish space Roomba. Her only hope is Scarlet, another girl who is a complete stranger and almost shot her in the head. Oh, and she has fox ears and a tail. That is possibly worth mentioning.
Artemis is not a nerd. She has never heard of the isekai genre, she can't fight worth a damn, and the blue-collar skills she learned at her community college are absolutely useless in a universe where technology is often indistinguishable from magic. She only has one thing going for her: A mysterious ability to interface with highly advanced technology left behind by the Antecessors, the long lost precursor civilization with technology that no one has been able to adequately replicate.
Finding herself in a universe where civilizations are locked in an interstellar Cold War, where societies are so stratified that the aristocracy commands fleets of starships while slaves wash clothes with their hands, Artemis decides to run away from it all. She has a ship. She'll find a crew. She'll find a way to make a living at the fringes of civilization, learn how to cope with danger, and survive the affections of a universe where everyone is a cute girl with animal ears and tails.

An old man has finally finished writing a journal that he has been keeping around for years; since his youth, he wrote this sort of guide of a fictional universe that he created himself. Through thick and thin, he pushed on with this project and, right when he was taking a long-deserved break from the evening spent on writing to smoke a cigarette on the balcony of his cheap apartment, the railing that held up for who knows how long decides to give in right at that moment. While falling, his last thoughts are only of regret and tinges of hope that one day someone finds that journal and enjoys it like he once wished for.
For many, this would be the end of the story, but due to his perseverance in this otherwise overlooked labor and journey, Death smiles upon him and grants him a lifelong wish that everyone can only dream of.

English is not my first language (and not even my second) but I don't care. I'm writing this to please myself.
Critiques are more than welcome, useless flaming is not if you don't like the premise, at least consider taking a look. If you still don't like it then there's little I can do, this might not be your cup of tea.
Inspirations: [The Administrator], The breath of creation (or RE: Deity, for older readers), World Keeper and Overseer. I strongly recommend you go check these novels out, they are all great and deserve a read more than my little ""thing"" (Especially ""Overseer"" and ""The breath of creation"", they are both amazingly done and at a level of writing I can only dream of achieving)
P.S.: This is my second attempt at writing a novel in general. I have tried with another novel (that I'm planning on re-writing later when I have much more experience) on this website and some others, but I haven't found much success (In fact, I'm very embarrassed by its quality). So if you find a novel titled ""The legacy of keepers"" (Not to be confused with ""Maria The Wanted and The Legacy of The Keepers"") by someone with my nickname, or something similar and it's dropped, then you have found my work.",5

This story takes your typical system apocalypse novel and fast forwards a few thousand years.

Starships fueled with aether are common modes of transportation. Colonization has occurred on most of the planets and moons within the solar system.
This story is a character focused space fantasy, following a ragtag team of unique individuals as they travel the solar system undertaking whatever quests and missions they manage to scrounge up. At least, until they find themselves embroiled in something much, much more... Read below for a synopsis.
The initial release will be relatively slow - about one chapter a week, every Monday. I’ll try to ramp up the output a little once we reach Arc 2. Arc 1 is mostly build-up and character development, gathering the cast together, but there’s still plenty of action and adventure! If you see any typos, mistakes, or clunky phrasing, please point it out in the comments! It really helps. Thanks for reading.

Synopsis:
Four unsuspecting individuals from drastically different walks of life end up on a ship together, taking any quests they can to keep the lights on and food on the table. 
Taryn is a down-on-her-luck mage from a previously influential family on Titania. After her father’s death and her mother’s descent into madness and disappearance, her family lost it all. She’s hunting for any clues to her mother’s whereabouts as they travel through the system. 
Zynth is a metal chimera that looks deceptively human. He was created by an illicit group of mages wanted in most quadrants of the solar system for necromancy and other forbidden taboos. As the first of his kind, he’s trying to keep a low profile while discovering what he really is and why he exists. 
Shen is the rogueish half-elf captain of the ship; one that has a tendency to get into trouble no matter where they dock. His first mate, Blood, is a minotaur that owes Shen a life-debt, acting as Shen’s second-in-command until he can repay said debt. They have a long and complicated history together, but it only takes a few drinks to coax it out of them.
Through a quirk of fate, they are thrust into the center of a situation far bigger than they realize when they come across a transport ship under attack by a bizarre starship the likes of which they’ve never seen. Wreathed in shadows and seeming to pour forth an unending wave of undead pirates from its belly, it was truly a ship of nightmares, but that was only the beginning...",3

She dreamt of riches and of becoming a hero. And before she even noticed she had spent all her saved money on a journey to the capital to enroll at Glattia Academy.
Did her journey as adventurer start because of power? A subconscious need for answers?  Was it due to her hope for a better life or to cover the wounds of her unloved childhood? 
In the end Cassandra couldn't even tell her own thoughts apart. Little did she know that  weakness and Ignorance can be blessings.

Notes: This is my first time writing on any sites, so please don't have any massive expectations. I wrote this on a whim in about 4 hours or so, honestly it's kind of cringy so I'm reluncant to share this on any platform.

You can think of it as a short story really. If anyone wishs to continue the story where I left off, I don't mind at all. English is not my first language by the way.

24301,A Journey Into Mario World,"Well I never expected myself to be writing about a story into the Mario World. It is really impressive how life makes you do things you never thought you would do. As for my previous stories I realized something. I made the character too OP and so on so blah. I will try again and this time I will try my best to reach at least 30 or so chapters with a decent or bad ending. If I go longer then may the god of authors be with me.
Each chapter will probably be around 1k words so its pretty short.
Moving on. My Synopsis for this story:
Abyss is once again thrown into a different world but this time is different. (Abyss is my favorite OC.) He is not in a world filled with magic spells, high tech, and all kinds of wonders such as dungeons. NO! He is thrown into the Mario World! Now lets read his journey into the Mario World!
Author's note: I think I did good. 
Negative side: No the synopsis is poor but whatever. You couldn't do better even if there were 100 of you. (Ignore him)

24303,Edge of the Abyss (Respawn Trials - 1) by A. Livadny,"What does technological development have in store for us?
Our nature is grounded in the basest of human feelings. Still, until recently I had no idea just how big the problem actually was. I’d spent twenty years of my life writing books about war, space exploration and artificial intelligence, firmly believing that humanity kept progressing morally as well as technologically.Still, my experience writing LitRPG has forced me to change my mind.
In order for my books to be believable, I spent a lot of time playing online – and the truth lurking behind some of the players’ avatars horrified me. The anonymity of the Internet tends to reveal what’s usually concealed by the veneer of civilization.
As I worked on the Phantom Server and Neuro trilogies, I still harbored some faith in humanity. But as I approached the task of writing Edge of Abyss, I did so in the firm belief that each human heart conceals a slew of vices which can break loose the moment a person tries on a virtual mask and acquires a taste for anonymity and impunity within game worlds.
We might actually invent full-immersion virtual pods quite soon, allowing us to experience whole new worlds first hand. The sheer thought makes my blood run cold. There’s a high danger of us losing what’s human about us, ultimately degenerating and eventually becoming extinct. And when we do realize the danger, it might be too late to do anything about it.
This is basically what my Respawn Trials series is about.

24308,The Man who knew no Limits,"The story follows the life of a man who gets teleported to another world with a strange power. And that is where the cliches end.
Common morals do not apply to the man. He is crude. He will do what he wants: he will not shy from using cheap tricks if it leads to a situation favourable to him. He will not save a damsel in distress if he doesn't want to, even if it is as easy as lifting a finger. He may even cause the distress himself if he finds it amusing. He may reward those who please him, while trampling those who are annoying. 
But the man's life, by no means, will be easy. He shall be OP, but it will not be enough, for some things just cannot be controlled.

24359,"The Mysteries of Fudan, and Other Rumors From the Metaworld","This is a fanfiction of the story Metaworld Chronicles and is made with the permission of the author
The deep and detailed world of Metaworld Chronicles is filled with interesting characters and magic and has a story that is excellent to say the least.
This isn't a story about the great and important adventures of the protagonist, Gwen Song.  Nor is this exploring some deep and interesting idea using Wutosama's world.  No, this is a collection of stories that fell through the cracks.  Little bits and pieces, rumors and mysteries, that mages and NoM's alike gossip about and speculate on.
Sometimes silly, sometimes sexy, sometimes a little tragic, and maybe even sometimes a bit horrific- these stories are sure to entertain a bored mage in a world without internet!
A word about Wutosama:  I never intended to write this.  A bunch of smaller fanfics that might contain scenes that could be described as a bit... steamy...  But when I asked Wutosama for permission, he said yes, and then asked me if it would be a sexy fanfic.  And of course, once the idea had been brought up- once the cat was out of the bag- I couldn't just let it go.  I asked myself, ""what kinds of misadventures could occur in a world like this?"" and the next thing I know, I'm writing about Richard being invited to a party and getting an eyeful of more than he bargained for.
Wutosama, behold Pandora's box, and know that you have opened it.  Beware the monsters that spring forth, because at this point I have simply too many ideas to not write at least some of them down!",93

24374,A Broken World [Rewrite],"In a world of floating islands of stone in the sky, where rivers flow through the air and defy gravity from one island to another, and ancient ruins can be found containing wonders beyond what can be produced by the lands current inhabitants- a millenia long war rages.
In the distant past, beyond recorded history, when the crown of humanity's glory, the city of Uri, had stood whole against the enroaching demon swarms- even as hope seemed lost, a band of heroes, against all odds, managed to steal powerful magical knowledge from the demons.  With the demon's forbidden knowledge, in the heart of Uri a new ritual was made.  Called, ""The Millenial Summoning,"" the ritual had the power to call a being from another world that would have the power to change the world forever.
The first being summoned became known as ""The Speaker,"" and he brought the power of the Gods to the world.  With the blessings and power of the new priests, the unstoppable demon hordes were finally halted.
A thousand years later, the ritual was used again and ""The First Sorceress"" was brought to the world.  She brought the knowledge of advanced magics, and techniques to find and refine magical talent.  With the magic power now added to the battlefield, the stalemate was broken.  And for the first time, the demons were pushed back.
Another thousand years later, and all of humanites hope for a final victory were dashed.  Traitors slew the ritual's participants and took their places, and humanity quaked as The Demon King stepped into the world.  His name, his nature, where he came from none of these are known, but what is known is his overwhelming power and his brilliant strategic leadership of the formerly formless hordes.
Still, despite their position being even more dire than it has ever been since history has been recorded, humanity held on for another thousand years.  Aided, thankfully, by The Demon King not taking the field after the first few years and battles.
Now, the ritual is being cast again and a new hero is being summoned.
In our world, after nearly three decades of study and hard work, Lucas Jaeger is making his dreams come true.  With a double doctorate in both genetics and microbiology, as well as an associates degree in accounting, he has finally, after nearly driving himself mad from stress and sick from overwork, been able to put to together a presentation and ask for a business loan.  His long time dream, earned by his own blood and sweat, to start his own commercial genetic company is finally coming to fruition.

One where the hero must defeat some ultimate evil. Well, there is no such thing as an ultimate evil. It is one hundred percent perspective. Ideals clashing with one another. And of course, all these races would have different ideals as well. Elves demand respect for the forests and nature. Dwarves regard craftsmanship as beauty. Demons respect strength, whether it be physical or magical. Humans regard growth and progression as the way of evolution. But when these species have been living right next to each other for millenia, their ideals and thought processes will have changed dramatically. Elves will still regard nature as sacred, but they will try and progress themselves while keeping nature safe. Dwarves will start to think that the traditional ways of crafting and forging will be a hinderance. That making improvements upon them will lead to better creations. Demons will start to see that strength isn't all you need to win a fight or battle. They will start to think that intelligence and strategy will help bring one to victory. Humans will start to see that they themselves are not superior. That they only stand on top because they have so many people. They have a greater chance of birthing a great warrior or strategist. But this is only the minority. The majority are still set in their ways. The old leaders refuse to give up their positions for the younger generations. It is a time of progression and moving forward. A time where they will have to change their ways of thinking. But of course, this wouldn't be easy. Especially when war is still raging on between them, and some very powerful beings start to meddle.",0

A singular member of this race being know as a ""Human,"" these Humans had taken over the planet in a matter of mere millenia. It was not without struggle, however, as the beasts that roamed the lands were viciously more powerful than these Humans. Many beasts, such as the ""Ifrit"" blessed by the power of Hellfire, or the ""Goblin"" scourged by weakness, were able to rip these humans to shreds no matter if they were weak as dirt or tremendous as a star. 
So how did ""Humanity"" arise from the ashes of never-ending war, victorious? It was all because of a single thing. Something that happened so suddenly, so quickly, that the beasts never had a chance to retaliate. Every single beast, no matter their power, disappeared one day. On that day, exactly 184,578 gigantic structures arose from Yelda, one for each of the beast races, excluding ""Humanity."" ""Humanity"" was spared from the sudden disapperance, blessed to roam Yelda without fear of being decimated by the beasts, freed from starvation at the hands of decimated crops and poisoned livestock.
The reason these structures arose was unknown until a brave group of Humans had decided to enter one. At the very moment that they walked through the door, cheered on by the supportive kingdom behind them, a voice rang out inside the head of every last Human on Yelda. What it said enlightened them, and they heeded its orders. After a mere day, every single human was now unrecognisable from before, as they were far more powerful now. They had unlocked the ""Runic System.""
This was the first of many gifts from this tremdous structure that shook the heavens and ravaged the earth. Only one name could suit this emperor of structures, sovereign of terror, king of rewards. It was hence named, on 23rd January 2218 according to the human calendar, The Infernal Dungeon.",17

24390,Yet Another RimWorld (Dropped),"*Fanfiction based on the game RimWorld*A more realistic take of RimWorld, where we follow the pawns that must struggle to survive in yet another Rimworld.
Their stories, guided by a particularly playful narrator, will tell the tales of survival, defeat, gains, losses, triumph, and ultimately ruin. Trials faced by people, in places of various circumstances, will be observed and presented to its audience.
What will be presented here are insignificant snippets of history, merely few of the innumerable tales and prospects to be found across this wide galaxy; The things we discover from these pawns, so many yet so few.
Ultimately, they are just more drama meant for enjoyment, albeit in a twisted way.
A/N:This is a fanfiction, based on the game ""RimWorld"". Using my personal gameplays as a basis for this fanfiction, in addition to some embellishments here and there.
Unlike the silly antics that caused grave consequences if you had ever played RimWorld, my rendition will (hopefully) stay more grounded to reality, whereby no one will go beserk and dig up corpses if they can't eat on a table for 3 days in a row. That's all I need to say, you get the point.
I'm writing this for fun. So please expect me to be inconsistent.

24392,Snereloa Rebirth,"In the darkest shining void, an ethereal being holding a scepter floats toward a nebula made up of the souls of the dead from all realms awaiting to be reutilized into the cycle. They aren't a deity of death, but one tracking an anomaly that can't be processed and completely wiped clean as they enjoy calling it. A fresh start, without shackles or remnants of what once was.

Life is a price paid by all living beings, but like any transaction, we give it something in exchange for our memories, our feelings, our emotions, our past, and future, our ambitions and our dreams.

Those all fuel the fire of creation, but so do grief, and pain.

Every moment of suffering is the price, every living moment is paid at our death. Sometimes some have so much piled up that their soul and heart end up damaged. Be it loss of trust or being unable to truly live their life, those shackles are like an anchor that keeps the soul stable when on the verge of breaking apart, keeping it together at an immense price.

Those unlucky souls are forced to be put into another life indebted, in the unlikely possibility of their defect healing themself in that new life. Their memories aren't intact after all—everything has a price—and that pain and fear are what they carry, while their partial amnesia is their shackle.

This is the story of one such soul, of a girl sent into a world of legend and novel of fantasy, dragons and magic. A world away from what she knew, in which she will hopefully heal, be happy, and survive its side of darkness.

Now trapped and powerless save for his knowledge of the secrets the world holds, he has to find his way back home. Hopefully to make it there in one piece.

Adventurers have always formed parties. Now, there are Dungeons, dark, grey blobs that dominate Kingdom maps and kill everything within sight. Yet, beyond even these obvious places of danger entwined with fortune, a forgotten evil rears its head after fermenting for millennia. A call for heroes has arrived. 
Warning: This story is written in the first and third person with multiple POVs. I will try to publish at least once every two weeks, if not more.

Please note: I am an amateur writer who started this story as a form of therapy while my wife was teetering on the brink of death. Thankfully she survived but by that point I was so committed to telling this story I couldn’t stop. I learned a great deal about writing over time but I am afraid my early chapters were very rough. I have since gone back and begun to edit them, applying the lessons learned and cleaning them up. I hope you will still enjoy the story, as I love sharing it and I can’t imagine a better use of my time.
Sexual content.. In seven books I have written two sex scenes, but one of them will be highly edited once I reach them with my rewrite. Overall I imply our characters are sharing their love but don't go into any great detail as to how. So if sexual content bothers you, it is only lightly touched on twice.

It's about everybody's favorite gun-slinging, face-punching, machete-chopping, morally bankrupt anti-hero: Sid Hansen.

He's tried everything, but every time he tries to talk to a hot chick she ends up telling him to get lost. Sometimes they call the police. Worse yet, Sid has run completely out of money, so he can't even pay for it anymore. He's seriously worried he'll never get laid again.
So when a billionaire puts a price on Sid's head and a cadre of sultry sex-pot assassins come looking to collect, Sid comes up with an idea so crass, so absurd, so unabashedly sexist, and so death-defying, that only he would ever have the steel balls required to pull it off...

24424,MAD MAGUS: A Tale of Almost Gods,"“Call me Lord Chaos and be done with it. And I said I have a job for you. It wasn’t a request.”

Salemon the Mage. Somehow, the name and the description didn’t fit together. 
But the woodcutter-turned-mage never really was a wielder of magic. He was more of a conduit for the suppressed urges and energies of a collection of almost-gods who had been trapped for millennia.

As a student of the prestigious Royal Academy, her work on magitech automatons needs to not only hold sway with her professors, but keep in step with her late mother, who practically wrote the book on humanity's mechanized companions.

24471,The White Rabbit,"In the Urillian Empire, the Empress Xandra rules three-quarters of the planet Xren from her home in the capital of the Earth Continent.  Both the fire and water peoples have fallen under her might after a series of wars stretching back three centuries.  Earth elves, under Xandra's rule, have spread throughout the planet and established colonies, and are, by all accounts, enjoying what seems to be a prosperous and happy existence.
But not everyone in Uril is happy.  The holy books speak of elves as the Chosen People of Thesis, tasked with guiding and protecting the lower races.  For some people, this scripture has been interpreted to designate their life as one on the lowest rungs of society.  Humans have been reduced to a slave class, and serve their elven masters under Xandra's rule, kept at bay by the constant fear of the dreaded Emerald Knight, and their own perceived weakness.  Humans do not lead long lives, nor do they possess the wisdom, power, or magical acumen of their elven masters.
But there is hope.  A group of people have banded together to fight against Xandra, her Knight, and her empire.  They call themselves the ""Knights of Order"" united under the principle idea that Xandra's reign has brought chaos unto Xren, and they wish to restore order.  These Knights are led by a man named Xaxac Brigaddon, spoken of as a legend.  They say that when the moons are full, some humans transform into powerful beasts.  They say that Xaxac is the most powerful warrior on Xren, that in his youth he was enslaved and forced to fight other humans to the death in a bloodsport called ""cage fighting"", that he could not be touched and held the world championship title for three years running until he faked his own death and escaped his master to join the resistance.  They say that he has friends in high places- noblemen, pirates, and the devil himself.  They say that if you can find him, he can ferry you to freedom in places where the Earth Elves fear to tread.  They say that he is immune to magical attack, and his eyes shine like the silver moon.  They say that he is descended from Quizlivian Brigaddon, one of the humans who helped the demon Magnus escape a god.
They say that if you want to walk the Path of Order, you should follow the White Rabbit.Come and watch the transformation from human boy to Knight of Order: The life and times of Xaxac OfAgalon OfLangil Brigaddon.
Content Warning: This work is based on the real experiences of human trafficing survivors.  Xaxac's origins are based on true events, and they are presented realisitcally; this includes but is not limited to: isolation, gaslighting, emotional and sexual abuse, and grooming tactics.  This work is meant to hold a mirror up to society; it is based on the real of experiences of people who have experienced slavery and/or abuse.  It is an adult work and probably should not be read by anyone under the age of 18.  If you are a survivor of human trafficing and/or abuse, your feedback is welcome, but please do not read this if you think it may trigger your trauma.  I did not write this with the intention of harming anyone, but rather to provide accurate representation for a group that does not normally get it in the hopes of changing the zeitgeist.  I would like to see a world where more people understand what these experiences are like, so that real survivors do not have to deal with microagressions from an ignorant public.  Reader discretion is highly advised.",42

Enjoy.
 
Adventurers enter dungeons every day. Battling evil monsters, defying dangerous terrain, triumphing over devious traps...
... but none of them ever ask why?
That arrow trap, who reloads it? The pitfall trap, who cleans out the bodies and sharpens the spikes? What if the grates get clogged, where will the blood and gore drain? When you are trying to study ancient lore or plan on conquering a kingdom, you don't want to worry about all that. You just want peace.
Mortis Operandi is a different kind of company. One that celebrates diversity. One that celebrates value in individuals. With flexible pay and plenty of advancement opportunities, it is a company that knows its workers are it's most valuable asset. As they design, build, and install traps, rooms, obstacles, and repair they are a one stop shop.
The sudden exit of Mortis Operandi's CEO, the company was facing ruin. The goblin Eft was choosen as the new CEO and boss. The previous CEO made promises and contracts that Eft now has to fulfill, and it is causing a lot of trouble. Restoring the ancestral home of Ogre's seems easy enough, what if a thriving town now resides there? Along with facing corporate invasion, Eft must take on the tasks he wouldn't wish upon his worst foe, Customer Service.

Laum was also destined to lead his village when the right time comes.However, things had changed and peace was disturbed in the islands of Maharlika. It was when foreign ships anchored near the shore of one of the islands. Some Rajah and Datus welcomed their new visitors with feast but some grew suspicious to the foreigner’s true intent. One of them was Laum’s Uncle. He even declared that their heads will be speared and will be the next decoration in their village if they don’t leave his island alone.The foreigners were unhappy with his aggression and loaded their cannons to annihilate the village of Laum’s Uncle. However, Laum’s uncle upheld his name, Pula-pula (Red-red), by bathing his whole body with the blood of the foreigners. He even killed the captain of the ships. The news quickly reached on the foreigner’s homeland, The Empire of Pantala.Instead of being displeased by the death of the captain, Pantala Empire celebrated for they found a reason for them to give retribution to the natives and conquered the new lands. They sent a message to the natives of the Maharlika; Submit to the Empire or taste its retaliation. Some villages resisted but most of the leaders sought that bloodshed was unnecessary and they yielded before the Empire. One of these leaders who surrendered was Rajah Suliman, brother of Pula-pula. What’s more intriguing was the council of Rajah Suliman advised him that they should compensate for the captain’s death and present Rajah Suliman’s inheritor to the Emperor of Pantala.Things went bitter for Laum. It was decided without his consent or even he was given notice about the council’s decision, he could do nothing to change it.

Authors Note:
I've improved my writing a lot. I think if this story does well, I'll finish the first volume.
I've read many books and novels published and written on RR. Growing tired of all the LitRPG and generic Wuxia stories, I decided to write something with the similar tone as a story called A Knight's Redo. It was removed a while ago from RR, but it was great (even if I forgot its name).

If those voices are to be believed, an ancient space station at the border of the galaxy speaks ill portents. Waking from a slumber aeons long, it brought with it the last of the humans it had kept in stasis.
Enter a story of magic and technology where mages battle with lightning and spaceships alike. Follow along as they explore the remnants of their golden age and rebuild their civilization from dust. They’re the paradox, the precursors come back to haunt the present.",43

24615,Afterlife Industries: The Devil's Day Job,"A divine comedy about God, his sons Lucifer and Jesus, and Their celestial organization Afterlife Industries.
Afterlife Industries is comprised of two main sectors -- and countless sectors under those -- Heaven and Hell.
Heaven is run by God and Jesus, but only on paper. Jesus is mostly a poster boy for the place; he prefers to walk among us and cure the affirmed. He's the only general practitioner who hates the FDA because far as he's concerned, there's almost nothing faith and love can't fix. And for everything else, there's Pinot Noir -- antioxidants and phytonutrients and all that. 
God, a talented artist who's never excelled at hospitality management -- reference the flood, plagues, Sodom and Gomorrah -- spends his days drinking and wallowing. Despite the world's flaws he still hasn't figured out why people aren't validating his artistry like they used to. (You wouldn't get mad at Michaelangelo if someone defaced Mona Lisa, would you?) 
In other words, angels actually run Heaven. 
Always the black sheep, Lucifer works tirelessly to keep Hell -- which is mostly just a very hot underground Library -- in order. Practically living in the dark ages, he still uses a filing system even more esoteric than Dewey decimal. Still, he tries his best. It's almost as if he's trying to prove he's been mislabeled. 
It's all worked out pretty well so far, but things are about to change.
The immortals Adam and Eve are still quite angry with the not-quite-holy trinity for the whole Eden thing, and are concocting a new plan for revenge. They use the resources at their company to hack into God's email account and, amidst a stream of cat memes the man upstairs likes sending to his sons, they find one rather useful email which God had written while drunk one night. 
It probably has something to do with kidnapping angels and demons, destroying the afterlife, and ending the world. There's always something with ending the world -- which is silly considering everyone knows the apocalypse is scheduled for 2050 anyway.",53

New heroes walk in a more technologically advanced world, the ancient blood of the gods still running in their veins, but a new age is about to dawn upon this world of gods and heroes. A new age of conflict and grand epic sagas, as hundreds of thousands, millions even, of new heroes and villains, the strange offspring of the gods and mortals of another world, arrive to fight for their own interests and goals.
The gods, forewarned by prophecy and hinted at by the wisest and strangest of the gods, Nexus, Guardian of Space and Lord of Secrets, acted to put plans in place to ensure the continued stability of their world, even as they prepared themselves for the inevitable changes to come. 
However, our story starts with a young woman and how she will find her place in the coming new age of strange heroes from another world who call themselves - Superheroes.

Comments on the tags:
Gender Bender is not used for comedic purposes – on the contrary I want to try to describe how someone would realistically react to this and what problems it might cause
Sexual Content: there are no explicit descriptions of sex scenes planned, but the MC will be forced to consider the consequences of the gender bender including sex and childbirth, and that is the reason for the tag. The second chapter will show the maximum level of descriptions I’m planning in this regard, use it to judge yourself (if I ever write something more explicit than in the second chapter, I’ll change this part of the summary).
Grimdark: This tag is imho a bit too broad, so here a better description: I call the worlds I designed to be “Fantasy Noir” in reference to Film Noir. This world is not apocalyptic and civilization still exists (and might even be great), but Society has failed and corruption and decadence are wide spread. This is also why there is traumatizing content like slavery and murder.

Hi! I am an avid reader of Litrpg who, after consuming a frankly emabarrasing amount of stories, decided to try his hand at one. To me this story is a bit of an experiment, I am not a native English speaker and I want to see wether I can produce a story that is fun and interesting to the readers here on RoyalRoad. That being said, if people like this story enough, I will try my best to write as frequently as possible, but due to IRL circumstances I don't have much spare time and therfore can't promise a schedule.
P.S as the story progress I may have to update tags such as gore and whatnot since I don't really know how the story will evolve, sorry if that's bothersome to some of you.

24713,what's it like to be the child of the most powerful heroes of all time?,"It all began 50 years ago when the semi-transparent blue screen started showing up in front of everyone, and class and skill was distributed across the world.
Two days after that phenomena, the skies looked as if they were on fire. All satellite communications were interrupted, as fear gripped the cities of the world. When the skies returned to normal, it became clear that a force of incredible magnitude, officially known as Variant had arrived on Earth. Its mission: to eliminate all life on the planet.
25 years after the arrival of system and Variant. Amongst the everlasting war for the future of humankind, one young man was living his life pretty safely, cleaning the basement of neighbour, his mind on the small problems of his easy life.
But then the world suddenly shifted and Portals were created. Because of the young man location during this phenomena, he got sucked into the portal and appeared in a dangerous place far above his level. With no combat skill or fighting knowledge, the young man struggled simply to survive inside the Portal.
But struggle he would, for this was how the young man heroic story began...
Years passed by, and the young man closed fifty-five Portals, won the Contest of Champion, reunited the countries, and Protected Earth from the darkest and most dangerous Variant who ever appeared, the Chromatic Dragon in the ground for good?
And after all those challenges, he finally met the love of his life, and had children.
So, the question is: what's it like to be the son of the most powerful heroes of all time?
Well, I think I, Kofi Latte, know the answer.
As I start my own journey, I discover just how much of a challenge it really is to live up to the legend of the strongest man on Earth. But before that, I have to learn the difference between being a hero and being the son of a hero.",4

Hey all, we're moving over to book 2. This content is in a state of transition.
 
The book is now availble on Amazon (includes extra chapters): 
https://www.royalroad.com/amazon/B07W1534R8

 

Artificial intelligence was nearly mankind’s last invention. AI took off like a rocket, then when it racked up an impressive death toll, it crashed before it could blossom and took most high-tech industries with it. Resistance and fears became deep-set.
Two decades after the infamous Rev. 4.6 incidents, humanity hasn’t quit dreaming of the wealth and power that could be at their fingertips. A new generation of mega-corporations rose from the ashes. When one melds a quantum computer to a barely functional mental patient as a PR move, there are those who seek to profit, those who want to destroy it, and Alex.
Alex Sage is a typical college student trying to keep up his grades and maybe find a meaningful connection with the fairer sex. Then, an automated semi crashes into his home, killing his family and turning his head into a pin cushion in the process.
Alex awakens to find most of his memories gone and an illegal AI hidden in his brain implant. Now the pet project of a tech billionaire and heavily in debt, Alex struggles to stay valuable enough to be kept online. Still grappling with the repercussions of his injuries, and threats from a dangerous anti-augmentation political movement, there are no easy answers and threats loom around every corner. Alex must use whatever resources he can to escape from under the thumb of a ruthless corporation, while keeping those he comes to love safe.
 

 

Chapters will stay up on RRL until Aug 10. It'll go up on Kindle Unlimited after that. 
How do you get those extra chapters I didn't have planned for RR? If you want them, they'll be in the published book. Book 2 will still make sense without them - I made sure of that.
But... isn't $3 a lot for extra chapters? Think of it as tipping me for a good job and you'd also be getting my eternal thanks. If you enjoyed it so much that the idea of missing out a few chapters haunts you, I did my job as an author and made an engaging story.
What's in those extra chapters? Resolving a few issues, set up for the cybernetic revolution, a rather intense sex scene with a new partner, revelations of who's really pulling strings, and a bit of set up for book 2.
Complaints that people missed out on it when it was published here won't help (sorry!). I posted this for the folks who helped me shape the book, which is you all! (Again, yay!)
But... Why! Why not keep it all on RR forever? My editor likes being paid for one. For two, I'd like the ability to get broader readership. If I break even on editor costs, I'll be incredibly happy.

What about book 2?

Drafts for Book 2 will go up around Sept 10. 
My draft of Book 2 is done, and it will be handed to the editor once Book 1 is published. Feedback has been even more positive. Beta readers devoured it and wanted more.
I'll add a link to Book 2 once it's up on RR. I'm more or less, using you all for Beta Readers, so you get it before it's ""canon"" and edited. I invite active and meaningful feedback during this process. In return, you get early access to chapters. That does mean that the book content or plot might be adjusted before it gets published as I refine it.
Sex Y/N? Yes. I heard the feedback, 90% wanted it explicit. You all will get the ""full"" experience.
Will I dump all of book 2 here? Honestly, I'm not sure yet. At a minimum, it'll be up to the 75% mark as we collect feedback, much like what I did with book 1. It really depends on how good the feedback is and how nice people are. Lots of support + meaningful feedback to make it better = higher likelihood you get all the book.
Will be it up here indefinitely? No, it'll probably go up on KU at some point, but I'll make sure there's enough time for a large readership to grab it here. Then we move to book 3 which already is around 60K words already.

What about other adventures in the same universe/characters?

Yep. Absolutely. Nothing ready to share yet though. I plan to keep those side chapters and more slice of life stories as RR exclusive. Since I'm carving this off in book-sized segments, I'll have to figure out where those disconnected story arcs belong. I'm open to suggestions.",280

24724,The System Wants To Be Human Again (Paused),"Important note: 
I will be temporarily pausing the posting of new chapters for this novel. I don't plan to stop writing it but I have finals coming up and at the recommendation of a few of my friends I am going to find someone to edit each chapter before I release them.
The pause will last around a month and a half until finals have passed, In the meantime, I will still be writing chapters so when I start posting again expect many, longer, better quality chapters.
 I know that I have only been posting for a week but I feel that due to my inexperience the quality suffers and I want this idea to work.
I am sorry to all of those who have enjoyed the novel so far, I just hope that you can forgive me on this one.
Thanks,

     Nevertheless, Licht would always choose to run and do his best to escape; however, no matter how hard he would try, he would always end up right where he had started when the day began. Wrapped in thick strands of dense, rich silk, and covered in countless shallow cuts, and startling massive scars... However, all will change soon, as this next escape attempt will be his last regardless of his first triumphant success, or his final, catastrophic failure.",8

24927,Chains of Dominion,"If Jake wins the local Fantasy Tactics Online tournament, he’ll have everything he’s ever dreamed of — a ticket out of town and the attention of a beautiful woman.
However, this woman has more planned for him than a bus ride to the local metropolis.  She teleports him back to her Realm and declares him her Master… and says it’s up to him to save the world.
No pressure.
Rival Dominions vie for power, and they are all far larger and more organized than Jake’s rag-tag group of women, but he has two advantages: the rules of this world are eerily similar to those of Fantasy Tactics Online, and his wildest dirtiest sexual fantasies act as a power multiplier for his all-female army.

Warning: The heroes have intense tactical battles, wild kinky sex, and near-constant flirtation.  The villains are disturbing and cruel.  If the idea of villains doing bad things bothers you, please do not read books ever, but especially don’t read this one.",336

24931,LitSense 1: A Collection of Short Feeling-Invoking Stories,"Hey, welcome to my new project.
I first got this idea when I was browing the SCP page. I'm not into SCP but I was linked to it from a forum thread. I found an SCP titled ""SCP-4522: The Mystical Village of the Jade Peach."" When I read the title, I immediately imagined a beautiful Chinese-style ancient village with blooming flowers and a glow of mana, with the scent of peaches flowing through the air. This reminded me of a time in High School where my friend gave an example of imagery stating ""Emerald green hills eclipsed by a glorious aurum sun."" Both the SCP and this example of imagery were just words, but they made me feel different, like I was actually in that location.
Since I'm human, I assume there are others that have an insatiable appetite for this kind of literature, therefore I am starting this project. Essentially, it will be a collection of short setting descriptions or stories that are evocative and allow you to get lost in another world. I will likely make this a ""non-shared"" collection, meaning there is no story progression between chapters, and rather each chapter is it's own story. 
Anyway, this is just going to be a fun hobby, I will likely not hold myself to any sort of schedule because that tends to burn me out. Hopefully you enjoy and make sure to let me know what you think by leaving a rating or a comment! I will probably make polls eventually to gauge what you guys want.",0

This is a rough draft and is intended to flesh out some ideas for a novel that I had. Maybe figure out if I want to do this author thing, you know? If you want immediately OP MCs, fights every chapter, a harem, this is not the story for you. Sorry about that. 
If you're willing to put up with a long growth curve, an MC that doesn't know what he's doing most of the time but is trying his best both to survive and to help his friends survive, you might enjoy the story. 
I'm just trying to have fun, maybe create something that in a second draft I can sell on the eBook market. If you're not into that, not into providing helpful comments for revisions, hey, that's cool, but do us both a favor and stop reading now.

Cameras and microphones are everywhere, super computers buried beneath the city serve as processors to judge the actions of everyone living within it, dealing out real life karma.
For years, peace reigns. The city is the envy of many, a place of prosperity and wealth. Then a number of trains malfunction, being routed through the city's blue external barrier, and the game begins. Gaining positive karma no longer gives discounts on goods, it gives otherworldly abilities, supernatural powers.
But gaining negative karma gives those same abilities as well.
The barrier surrounding the city becomes charged, turning anyone who wishes to leave into a pile of ash. Forced into the seemingly impossible game of good and evil, the new residents of the city must decide which side they're on or remain helpless.

24949,Oracle by Default,"Your average save the world trope with a dark twist.
Oracles were known as divine handouts passed down from the Holy Creator to give guidance to the people. What does it mean if the title of Oracle is bestowed upon an individual?
A call for adventuring, dungeon diving, slaying monster, right? Maybe. Before an individual named Kihet could fulfill his dream of embarking a grand adventure, a tragedy from his past returned to haunt him.
Kihet couldn’t remember much of an unfortunate accident that left many important hunters and loved ones dead. He only recalled a vague memory of a mysterious man etching a mysterious marking on him and recited some words from an ominous book in hand.
""For the reckoning that is to come, all are tested. Thou shall be the shadow of which valiant souls shine and guide thee through harsh trials. Till oblivion comes, do not turn astray but to continue down the path thou chosen to walk. Lastly, thou must not see eye to eye with, but against the world.""
What does it mean? Does it relate to the mysterious Tower only Kihet and his friends could see? What dark secrets unfold as he tried to look for answers?

DISCLAIMERS BELOW  
This is (as you can probably tell) my first real public work, so any feedback is encouraged and appreciated. I have much of this story planned out, and if all goes well, it is a tale that will be long in telling.
There will be multiple unique POVs, some of which may never interact with any of the others. Each character is written with a goal all its own, and a specific purpose in building the world / furthering the plot. With this in mind, I would like to point out that the number of tags is indeed quite large, but most will only be found in 1 or 2 of the POVs, and certainly not all. Please also consider that at this time, many tags may not be represented right away, as they are only slated to occur much further down the road.
Only 1-2 chapters a month will be written in the POV of the ""protagonist."" As the reader, you will be able to influence the actions of the MC through polls on the regular chapters. These 2nd person POV chapters will be much longer, but also appear less often. I understand if this is not ideal for those that want to participate, but this is all practice for me, so it might not reach its full potential for some time.",6

One of my favorite series of books is the Magicians by Lev Grossman and I hope to follow that same line of thinking within my story. How would a society built around magic actually exist and is power and magic actually as great as other stories make it out to be? The story and characters will be completely original and I will try to update the story on a regular basis.

25225,Delve,"Summary – Level 1:
Delve is an isekai litrpg that follows an average guy who just happened to wake up in a forest one day. He wasn’t summoned to defeat the demon lord or to save the world or anything like that, at least as far as he can tell. The only creature there to greet him was a regular old squirrel.
Soon enough, he meets other people, only to discover that he can’t speak the language, and that not everybody immediately trusts random pajama-wearing strangers they met in the middle of the wilderness. Things generally go downhill from there, at least until the blue boxes start appearing.
Delve is a story about finding your way in a new, strange, and dangerous world. It’s about avoiding death, figuring out what the heck is going on, and trying to make some friends along the way. It’s not about getting home, so much as finding a new one.
Did I mention that there will be math?
 

 Summary – Level 2:



 Okay, but what are you in for, really?
Well, this story is supposed to be realistic, or at least, as realistic as a fantasy litrpg can be. The main character doesn’t instantly become an all-powerful god and murder-hobo his way across the universe. Delve is, at its heart, a progression fantasy, but that progression is meant to feel earned. The numbers in this story actually mean something. Everything is calculated, and if you find a rounding error, I expect you to tell me about it. That said, if math isn’t your cup of tea, there is plenty more that the story has to offer. Characters are meant to feel real, and progression isn’t only about personal power; it’s also about allies, connections, and above all, knowledge. Figuring out how the system works is a significant theme.
 
...
 
What, you want more details? Okay, fine, but this is going to get a bit spoiler-y. Are you sure?
 

Yes!


 
Really sure? I mean, this summary is practically half as long as the first chap–
 

Now!


 
Okay, okay!
The main character becomes a magic user, but he takes a route that is not very popular in adventurer culture, namely that of a support. There is a full magic system with various spells, skills, and abilities, but our MC decides that aura magic is the way to go, and that the only stat worth investing in is mana regeneration. Most people at the Adventurer’s Guild think that this makes him a bit of a dumbass, but he’s playing the long game. We’ll see how that works out for him, won’t we?
Because of his build, the MC levels up fast, at least compared to normal people. There are no cheats, though, and he is limited in other ways. There are some clear and pretty obvious downsides to his build. That’s what makes it fun, no?
Morals? Our MC has them. Again, we’ll see how that works out for him. Realism, remember? Would you be okay with killing someone and looting their body? I sure hope not.
POV? The focus is on the main character, but there will be occasional varying perspectives from people around him, or involved in the events related to the main plot. It isn’t going to jump all over the place.
Tech is standard medieval stasis. No smartphones, but the MC does have a technical background. Computers and their programming might be involved. There might even be a bit of uplifting down the road, who knows? Anyway, it isn’t the focus. He isn’t going to invent the gun in chapter 1 and change the face of warfare.
Romance is not a major focus. Friendships are more the name of the game, though there will be some characters in romantic relationships.
There is exploration, though not as much of the geographical nature as you might expect. It is more about exploration of the system and the culture.
The pace is slow and detailed, sometimes verging on slice-of-life. The action is meant to be realistic and grounded in the numbers, and it is intended to have meaning beyond simply punching things until they stop moving.
The general tone of the story is grey, and some parts can get quite dark. People die. Sometimes, people with names, but not anywhere near GoT level. There is plenty of light, too, though, to balance the darkness. The world is dangerous, but overcoming that danger is why we’re all here, isn’t it?
Anyway, if you’ve made it this far through the summary, you clearly like words. I hope you enjoy the story!

25237,God Gene,"(Warning, full of magic and pseudoscience and sci-fi nonsense)
Humanity has reached an unprecedented level of progress in all areas of life. Seeking expansion they look towards the stars only to find they are not as alone in the universe as they had thought. Unknown horrors roam the galaxies and they have set their eyes upon the newly spacefaring people. Devastating wars on all fronts pushed back centuries of progress.
Planet by planet the battle line encloses upon humanity like a tightening noose. Desperately looking for a solution they turned towards religion during their darkest hour. Their plead was not in vain. The emergence of slumbering Myths and the rise of new Legends fought back against the onslaught of invaders.
Hidden experts lead the path towards a new Era, of Heros and Gods. The lost arts of Cultivation and the bonds between pantheons has been established once more. Thousands of years have passed and James Young has found himself displaced within a future he couldn't have imagined in his wildest dream. However, it is a world that has passed him by, full of strange people and customs. Can he etch out a place for himself in such an illogical world where might makes right and the rules of the jungle prevail over logic? 
Armed with only his knowledge of stories and folk tales from the ancient past he will learn that in a world where the Gods are real, such Lost Lore is priceless. Now if only he can survive long enough to make use of it, for he will soon realize he isn't the only one with an advantage.
If you have read Legend of the mythological gene or Super God Gene, then you really don't need to read this. The same premise pretty much. This is a parody of the LMG, which in itself is a fanfic (or so I have heard, never read that far) I just thought the concept was cool.",4

25242,Merl against zombies,"The world changed in the blink of an eye. Zombies are now everywhere, but there is still hope. Some people have been gifted powers to fight back against the new plague that roams earth. One of these gifted people is merl and his power will make him a god. Infinite in potential and full of exploits, his personal power will grow immensely. At least eventually...

Story revolves mostly around Merl, his shop system, gaining more power and zombies.

Warning - Some people might get offended by some of the content, I hope otherwise, but it might happen.",13
25243,The Rejection,"A short story of choice, love, pain and consequences.",3
25244,A Game of Villains,"Top-rated Russian Dystopian LitRPG Series is now available on Amazon.They lied, they lie, they will lie. This world is built on deception.
Vasily entered the store that fateful evening and became involved in a life-or-death game arranged by a mysterious creature. He survived, but instead of being on Earth, he now appeared to be in a different world, with other people who had passed a similarly deadly test. Some made it through by using force, some by using their cunning… Everyone has their own story, but they all have one thing in common — there are no good people among them.
The world of Karik turned out to be akin to a game. In it, one can level up, grow stronger, even resurrect in case of failure. But if one makes a mistake of believing the wrong person, they will die for good. Will the magic that Vasily needs to conceal, or maybe his patron, who seems incapable of telling the truth, help him? Who can say?",420
25245,Cayleth,"The world is not a benevolent place, it never was, and never will be, be it the harsh embrace of mother nature, the primal brutality of beasts, or the cunning and malice of the thinking, there is all but one truth, only the powerful shall thrive, all others are stepping stones or nourishment.
In a world where magic runs amok, death lies on every turn and choice, and beasts powerful beyond measure claim the wilderness for their own, Man is one of many species fighting for survival, building their countries and waging war against the wilds, carving a path for themselves in this world through cunning and bloodshed; but humanity is not alone for there are those who share the same path.
Allies, Enemies, Xenos all with the same goal, to survive and thrive, but where the thinking set foot there is greed and envy, for equality is imaginary and taking is a right of the strong.
In Village on the borders of humanity’s domain over the wilds, a Girl with mixed blood made orphan by the scars of conflict, denied the status of human by her heritage loses herself in the wilds and an encounter changes her fate forever; can the bonds of family and friendship she found in this cold cruel world hold back the weight of what she became?

Hello, this is my first novel, so I apologize in advance for any grammar mistakes/weirdly worded sentences, as English is not my first language, and although I think myself picky with the stuff I write, I know a few mistakes will bleed through eventually.
This novel has been sitting on the back of my mind for a little while, it’s not the first I tried to write, but will be the first I bother to share with someone, and actually go through with the concept, so any feedback, criticisms, or ideas are very much appreciated; even though I know where I want to take this story and some of the key plot points I want to achieve, I fully expect to change/rewrite it as  I regulate and get comfortable with writing and the tone I want to give the story.
The story accompanies the adventures of Cayleth, a half-elf girl (although she’s not going to stay that way forever, no spoilers though), and her companions that will be introduced later in the story; yes it is a fantasy world, but no reincarnators, no game elements, and no OP mc just dick waving his way through the story.
As for chapter themselves, I’d say I'm able to commit to 1, or 2 2000 to 3000 words chapters a week, maybe more depending on how the story is received and how much time I have; I'm keeping a backlog of about 3 chapters ahead and I plan to stick to that, I’d build more before posting but I want some feedback first in case I messed up badly and these first chapters are no bueno.

Has it never occurred to him that when there is a crisis in Jiang family, Mandy Song agrees to their marriage without slightest hesitation, for what? Charlie Jiang never cares for Mandy Song, so he never knows that for such a long time he used to be her world, her whole world.

25254,Forgotten Dungeon,"The story had been published only on royalroad.com and if you're reading it anywhere else it has been stolen.
Death comes quickly and without warning. Even for such little personage as him.
It's quite hard to start as a dungeon core. Quite harder when divine bureaucracy simply dumps you in the a** end of nowhere because of their incompetence and because of your agent status as a Fallen Angel.
Yet Uno (temporary name) is used to working with subpar materials and making the best of circumstances. It doesn't help that his personality was cut down to size, but he tries to overcome the system with ingenuity and a healthy dose of duct tape. Or the local equivalent of such.

An audiobook of the Forgotten Dungeon story has been made by Agro Squerrils and is available on YouTube, under this link: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeGEGF1MrdbSWy2b3NEiwhohLM6ptUKB1 He has my permission and full support for doing so, so don't be shy and check it out!

Hello people! It's a story about a dungeon. Or maybe the dungeon? Who knows. Dumped in a hostile world, working hard to overcome circumstances. There is an RPG system in place, but I'll try to make it not number-heavy. I would be more focused on skills - at least from the perspective of the sentient races. Dungeons will have their own little playground.
I'll try to make MC not overpowered - it always irks me how the stories tend to go from zero to hero in a few minutes. I hope y'all will enjoy the ride!

But when he finally gets a job he gets killed in a car accident and reincarnates into another world where luckily he is a genius.

25260,Sarsaparilla's Scary Super Power. Completed,"Sarsaparilla is an older teenage girl living on Mars. And, like many other young people around her, she has a super power. Or, rather, she is supposed to have a super power. Only she has never been able to activate it, she doesn’t even know what her super power is. This annoys her, tremendously. But she hides this behind a really sweet smile.
Adalace is another teenage girl, also on Mars. She knows what her own super power is, and it is quite a good one. She is also really cute… so long has she keeps her feelings under control and doesn’t let out anything from her dark past.
Teylon is a man, currently living on Earth. He likes to think of himself as still young, even if he is over fifty. He’s a bit smug about his successful career and is thinking of retiring… until a sadly unfortunate event leads him to the conclusion that he had better immigrate to Mars. Immediately. Apparently, meeting one’s own Angel of Death tends to cause people to make profound changes to their lives…
Mars society had better brace itself, because once these three people, plus another three also not so quite stable individuals, collide with each other, the resulting explosion is not going to leave anyone on Mars unaffected.

This is another Esmeralda, the Angel of Death, story. It follows on from my previous two such stories, but it is in no way dependent on the previous stories. They can be read in any order.
It is fully written and proof read (using Word for Windows, no real editor touched this transcript) and comes to about 247,000 words (about 895 Royal Road pages). It is organized into 50 chapters and I will be publishing them roughly one per day.
In my writing, there are multiple characters and multiple points of view. Each change in a point of view is introduced by a header, giving the viewpoint character’s name first, and possibly a title. Inside a Point of View section, dialog in italics represents the Point of View character’s thoughts, while dialog between quotes represent normal spoken dialog.
This story is very much inspired by the anime A Certain Scientific Railgun. However I have only taken some elements from the anime, and changed everything I took to make my own story, and so it does not count as fanfiction.

Yeah, I know, the book cover page isn’t very good. It’s the best I could do, by tracing over a stock image. The two ladies shown are supposed to be Adalace and Sarsaparilla. Ideally I would have liked there to be two images of this pair, one where they are smiling sweetly and looking cute, and one where they are looking really angry and dangerous.

The main character dies of a heart attack and awakens in another world, alone and in a cave with the body of a newborn baby. However he also has increased mind based stats due to his memories, so expect a somewhat op start, but no where near all powerful for the world. There is no real plot, the main character is just trying to figure out what he can before something that already knows what it is doing manages to kill him first.

25274,Ghostified City,"‘Ghostified City’ is a post-dystopian sci-fi tale, set in a fading world that might be a future version of ours, running out on autopilot into oblivion. Adaman Yimmand is a simple robofactory operator in The City who's working with robots and machines every day. He doesn’t even realise that he might not have met another actual human being in years. Everything begins when he breaks his routine for once and enters a bar where he meets Evelith. This pesky other person does not let him go after he has had his -rather terrible- beer, because according to her actual humans are much rarer than he’s aware of. And from then on ‘the genie is out of the bottle and won’t get back in’, to use her words: Adaman meets more people, and gradually he has no choice but to accept that the reality of The City is not what he always thought it was, and to face the darkness of a fading humanity on the brink of self-inflicted extinction.Is there any hope left for him, and for his species?
I have selected 'sexual content' and 'traumatising content' to be on the safe side, because there is a stripclub-like venue in the background of the story, and an almost-extinct humanity that has institutionalised suicide which might be disturbing to some. Apart from that it's not really a heavy 'adult' story.('Ghostified City' is my first long story in English as opposed to my native language Dutch, and an earlier version was published on my fiction blog 'Oranderra' until I stopped updating. This is a slightly altered version of the first series.)",13

Her only joy was the small inconveniences an error in her work could bring, the resulting punishment a small price to pay. When the news came she was to be sacrificed in a grand ritual, she welcomed it—for most, death was a cause for grief and mourning, but for Aperio, it was her only way out.
However, during the final stages, something went wrong. Fate intervened, and Aperio found herself in a world she no longer knew, with powers beyond her wildest dreams. No longer a slave to the Empire, she set out to find her place in the world, and enjoy true freedom for the first time in her life.

* * *
When the world filled with darkness, the Heaven smile upon them. The light bestowed, and the gate to the Kingdom open and a new beginning is about to start...
In time the Lord of Darkness nearly conquers the world, a Knight of Heaven was born in a form of a supernatural human, then another door open for the sinner.
The Son of God is coming, so the world must be prepared, and the path must be cleared out. The human will be judged, not by the hand of the Begotten Son, but by the Heaven's Knight Sword.
When a sinner cannot bear to watch how the world is dying, he offered himself to begin the New World.
 ? ? ?
This is a story, begin with an Elf prince named Grail. His ancestors betrayed Heaven, and so, they were punished and fell into the land named Earth.
Their wings fragmented into billions of shining dust in the shore, beneath this universe. They descended down to the Earth and never ever reach Heaven anymore. They have watched how the world reborn, over and over again for billion years.
With the small power left of their immortality, they survive from an endless battle of fallen angels over the land. The hatred and greed fill their hearts, and each of them sought to conquer to lead.
Then, one by one they began seeking each other's power to survive and continue sheltering on Earth... Till a group of two, five, twelve until they have gathered countless numbers, the stronger they stand and start living as prosperous sinners.
But defeats makes another hatred ablaze, they may keep silent and live in the dark... but waiting, waiting and waiting...
They watch how the human passes by the sinner's sins until they persuade the whole world.
And in the place where a prosperous sinner standing in the higher place, he looks over the land, his heart is breaking. May his ancestors made the biggest mistake of their immortality, but like other Elves, he turns to love the humans despite their foolishness. He felt that he must do something, he wants to do the right thing.
And so, he keeps silent no more. He traveled the world. Visiting his brothers over the world who live in harmony and peacefully and choose to harm no human. When he is very young, he always hears news all over the world when a war breaks over nations.
They were reports that some of the Elves help a little to the humans. Either give food or give shelter in the middle of the war.
So the Prince believe, that his brothers will give a hand.
On his journey, he always runs into some various accidents.
One time, there was a car accident and he saved the victim. A truck runs so fast because the driver lost control and hit the car in front of it. The car along with the truck slam into the tunnel's entrance. Everyone knows that there is no way that someone would be going to survive in that crushed.
But the Elf prince did not just stay standing and watch. He runs to the driver seat and protects the old man over the steering wheel. When the crushed over, the witnesses start checking the truck and car for survivors.
The truck driver died on the spot and to their shocked, the car driver was alive. May he has the injury on his head, but there is nothing other than that.
The Elf prince visits the old man at the hospital to make sure he is totally fine. The old man lively telling everyone that he feels that someone is holding him tight from the impact.
It's not the only incident the Elf prince get into. There was also another car accident but only the infant be able to protect at that moment. Walking in the land by a human form, his power sealed off. Only a small amount he could be used.

Author's Thoughts:
What is litRPG
(From wikipedia) - LitRPG, short for Literary Role Playing Game, is a literary genre combining the conventions of MMORPGs with science-fiction fantasy novels.[1] LitRPG is a literary genre where games or game-like challenges form an essential part of the story. A LitRPG work simultaneously narrates the story of characters inside and outside of the game-world. At least some of the characters in a LitRPG novel therefore understand that they are playing a game: they are 'meta-aware'. So, while Tolkien's Lord of the Rings is a fantasy novel, a book about people creating avatars and interacting in a Lord of the Rings MMORPG would be a LitRPG novel.Why do I read them? You know, I am not too sure. I love MMOs. I played them, quit them, joined up and repeated the cycle. They are fun! They are a massive waste of time but so are most games. Do I want to read about someone else playing them? Sort of?The advent of VR and the possibility of VR someday becoming so immersive that you can't tell them from reality sets the imagination on fire. What if this could be life? But most stories fall short. At the end of the day the protagonist hangs up his VR helmet and goes to have dinner with his mom and dad or other family and it becomes meaningless. It's like the story that ends because the main character woke up and nothing you read matters.There have been some books that explore the concept of the intersection of reality and total immersion VR. Enders Game is a classic. There were a few others that escape me but they exist, however, the cross between the game and reality is weak.So what if the game was real? The technology needed for total immersion VR is so advanced that by the time we reach that goal technology should have naturally evolved to include several items.

You must have direct neural input. You simply can't have a total immersion (all senses and perfect presence) experience without this basic prerequisite.
If you have direct neural access, you can probably do neat things like feed knowledge and skills directly to that person. You can undoubtedly do many horrible things as well.
Muscles are controlled by the brain. If you control the brain why would you let the body just sit there and rot? A person that sits unmoving for 24 hours a day will have their body whither away just like a coma patient. However, if you control the brain you could control the muscles. On a basic level, this would be isometric impulses, working muscle group against muscle group to avoid atrophy. Taken to its logical conclusion you would be able to gain muscle mass and program muscle memory. The flip side is that you could remote control their body... but let's not go there.

So what would people do if it were real? Well, they would probably limit and regulate it since the drawbacks are very obvious. Even if you look at the basic aspects of this you can see some negative possibilities. Look at the Sword Art Online anime. Personally, I think they missed the boat by putting a bomb in the VR helmet. Do you really need a bomb when you have direct access to the brain?So what kind of events would you need to have a situation where the obvious drawbacks haven't been explored? Maybe a society where the advancement of technology has so far outstripped the explorations of its applications that ignorance was truly bliss? Okay, so I had to put in an alien invasion to kickstart the premise, but that was just one of the possibilities.",42

Cover art by Tumblr User: @pigeon-princess
This book features characters that are related to in many ways to my other novel ""Grimoire"". While both stories are their own stand alone series, Sun God's Corruption will add a good amount of depth to Grimoire, and Grimoire shows the unfoldings of the world that will eventually come from the events in Sun God's Corruption.  I reccomend reading them both interchangably.",12

However, I am full of enthusiasm and believe, that the sales will cover the translation.

25354,Omnipocalypse Monsters(Shelved Timeline),"System Edit: This timeline has been shelved, but the adventures of the Omegas and her kids will continue in the next System Update Timeline with additional foes and challenges early on to guide the Omegas into a less destructive path of protection.The Omnipocalypse was every apocalypse humans ever imagined all happening at once, zombies, plagues, nukes, EMPs, Robot uprisings. Not just the earth either, It happened to every World ever dreamed up by men too: heaven, hell, and every other afterlife or spirit world ended, plus the worlds of books and stories bled into reality. It all broke apart and either; became new places on the chaotic Earth or part of the even messier spirit world. Magic beasts mutated by radiation, Robots mastering Magic, the mixture of everything made the horrors... well, more horrible. Omega; A young Woman with few memories wakes to find she has spent 2500 years in stasis, in a basement of scientific horrors. Creatures and Things that could supposedly destroy the world if ever let free. Horrors of which she was the last to get free. Rather then Quest for world domination or destruction; Omega keeps getting drawn into a protective role over other orphans, lost monsters, and broken AIs. So she decides to build something to help all her little monster family be safe. -------This story is meant to be a behind the scenes look at stories about kids solving problems that should be beyond them. I always wanted to see a story about Professor Oak, Dumbledore, or any other mentor who trains the main characters. I like the idea of someone looking at the apocalyptic world and deciding to make it safe enough that a small child can wander off and make some monster their pet. The pokemon games have fun systems to consider the behind the scenes workings of, like what training a team rocket member goes through to become a villain cut out for children to defeat. how they prevent a deific pokemon from accidentally murdering some little rat with its immense psionic power. However, the story itself is not really meant to be a pokemon parody, I draw inspiration from every genre of fiction, any type of game, this story is the only one I plan of ever writing without a clear cut ending planned, I love the infinite storytelling capacity of things like Doctor who's TARDIS, the Stargate or Rick's portal gun. In this case, I wanted the setting itself to be one where any and every story might happen. Cover Image by kalli gruen from Pixabay

As such, when death came to take her life, she said nothing. 
 
With an empty heart, memories that felt more artificial than anything, and identity that she could barely even vouch for, she died to save someone who had eyes that wanted to live.
 
Someone who was desperate for a future. 
 
She died for someone whose need for a life exceeded hers. 
 
 
But if there was anything that she'd never even considered, it was that she might get another chance to live.
 
And the Gods granted her that exact same chance.

25400,Transformers: Heroes,"Heroic Decepticons Alternate Universe. A century ago, the eons-old war between the Autobots and the Decepticons suddenly and inexplicably came to an end. Since then, many have gone their separate ways, whilst others still hold onto the bitter memories of war. Now, as Autobots and Neutrals join forces in a new directive to capture every Decepticon still left alive, it appears that the Autobots will finally get their chance to even the score, and defeat their enemies once and for all. But when they become the target of seemingly random, yet terrifying attacks, some begin to realize that the enemy may be much closer to home than anyone could have ever imagined.
Author's Notes: 
While it helps to have a little bit of prior knowledge about the world of Transformers, you don't need to be a Transformers fan to enjoy this story, or even a Decepticons fan! One thing I can say for sure is that it is unlike any Transformers fan fiction you've ever come across.
This story aims to explore one possible set of motivations in depth in a setting of ongoing conflict between the Autobots (and, more recently, the Alliance - a collaboration between Autobots and Neutrals) and the Decepticons.
Although this story takes a lot of things from the G1 cartoon, it is by no means strictly G1 toon oriented and introduces characters and/or ideas from other continuities (Sentinel Prime, Jhiaxus, Thunderblast and Rook (not the Autobot Rook - the other Rook!). Set primarily on Cybertron and Alternity City, it also deviates from certain key elements common in Transformers canon. For one thing, the general consensus that all Autobots are good and all Decepticons are bad is challenged, and a new meaning to the motivations behind their conflict is offered (which is a recurring theme in my Heroic Decepticons Alternate Universes). Some personalities have been altered from their canonical profiles as a necessity (Megatron being the most obvious example) and developed to a much deeper level than the original cartoon allowed.
I hope you enjoy and thanks for reading.",15

25421,"Tales of Ordinary, Completely Unremarkable Contractors","""Where life had no value, death, sometimes, had its price. That is why the mercenaries appeared."" - Artur Xerxes, in A Century of Disappointment: Memoirs of a Travelling Dwarf
It's never too difficult to land contracts for a set very specialised skills in a continent teeming with werewolves, vampires, giant leopards, undead and, god forbid, elves.
The difficulty comes when these contractors find themselves suffocated in the dense atmosphere of this world's rigid - and mostly unfair - rules; death, suffering and misfortune await those unwilling to sacrifice to bend these in their favour.
In this non-linear plot, you will observe a scarred and deformed farm girl cashing her first bounty posters, a seemingly ordinary barmaid at a tavern in the bustling centre of a sprawling, corrupt city and an enigmatic leader of a firm specialising in dealings any other would consider suicidal.
Watch them all take everything to the next level at every available opportunity, and then feel dread at the thought that this still might not be enough to halt the physical embodiment of doom about to do what it does best

25475,Palus Somni,"It is the final days after the end of the world and you only have one month left before the last sanctuary erupts into chaos. There's a dead body hanging from a tree and cadaverous giants watch you sleep at night. The end is already here, you just don't know it yet.

Now rated in the top 3% of all novels on Royal Road!

Palus Somni (‘Marsh of Sleep’) is a worldbuilding webnovel about what happens when your God forsakes you.
Inspired by gothic horror and mingled with British myth and folklore, join the Alucinari nuns as they struggle with day-to-day life after the world has ended.
Every night when the sun sets the monstrous Gol, colossal beings with too many teeth, awaken and roam the marshlands. Only those with a faithful heart will be spared. Young acolyte Wille has never seen the walls fail, but when a fellow nun is murdered within their sanctum the very safety of the monastery is thrown into question. Did the Gol find a way to breach their defences, or is there a human traitor amongst them? The answer lies both far in the past and deep beneath the earth, through the maze of ancient catacombs.
With a cast of over thirty different characters, watch as your friends and enemies spiral into inevitable madness at the hands of a callous and unforgiving world. Discover the secrets of Palus Somni through letters, diary entries and notes found scattered across the monastery. Uncover the mystery of the grotesque giants that stalk the night and bring your challenge to the Gods themselves.
Each character has their own handmade pixel art, and every update includes a music recommendation for a dark atmospheric dungeon synth album that you can listen to while you read.
Slice of life meets cosmic abomination: Palus Somni is a collection of intertwining stories, some chapters are stand-alone tales while others feed into the overarching narrative. It is an exploration into a community, and rather than focusing on any one character the story meanders through the convent, exposing the hopes and fears of its inhabitants.

Alisson Vi Nuam and Celistine Regadonia; the master and the apprentice, although meek, must push outside their boundaries if they wish to survive, and aid their fellow comrades in victory. Victory however, means victory against the entire world. Sidonian forces are of course higher quality than the rest of the human scum on the continent, but quality over quantity can only get you so far when you’re outnumbered by such a large factor. 
Decrepit beasts roam the tunnels under the ground, and humans are all too happy to squash another subhuman nation such as Sidonia. With a sudden surprise attack launched on Sidonia, and war being declared, it’s only a matter of time until the vastly larger human armies march down the continent and overwhelm the speck at the bottom of the map that is Sidonia.
However, the orders Alisson receives one fateful day may be the key to his species survival, or an elaborate way of saying ‘die’. Either way, orders are orders, and even if the Lady Sidonia did tell him to take his own life, he would do so in a heartbeat, as would any Sidonian as Alisson could imagine. This sentiment however, unbeknownst to Alisson, is subject to change, especially when he receives a brand-new apprentice to follow him everywhere. She may prove yet to be Alisson’s first real friend. Because what's a better method of bonding than being hunted by both human and monster alike?

Updates sparsely every couple weeks; this is a hobby, not my jobby :) Takes inspiration from everything from Metro 2033 by Dmitry Glukovsky to the Spice and Wolf series by Isuna Hasekura. The main characters are not overly powerful, there is no cultivation, and there are no levels. The world isn't defined or spoonfed to the reader, and care has been taken to make sure every character seems human, no matter their importance to the plot.

25550,Crimson Gloom,"Crimson Gloom.
The time when the moon turns crimson, illuminating the landscape with its crimson glow.
The time when the ‘doors’ to the Crimson Abyss open.
One shall gaze into the abyss and gain its secrets and powers. Concurrently, the abyss also gazes into oneself, gaining one’s sanity and humanity.

Dimensional rifts appeared spontaneously on Earth, bringing otherworldly demons along with the Crimson Gloom. Bloody battles were fought, noble sacrifices were made. Humans eventually sealed the rifts and successfully defended their homeworld.
Alas, the seals were not perfect. The Crimson Abyss continued to exist, slowly influencing Earth and its inhabitants.
Half a century of relatively uneventful years passed… humanity slowly descended into corruption, and the majority of them knew nothing of the effects of the Crimson Abyss.
Is there only the dreadful gloom left to the world? Can one find brightness in the increasingly gloomy world?
The youth who had gazed into the Crimson Abyss had no answer, nor did he care. He only wanted the Crimson Gloom to end, to forever seal the Crimson Abyss.
A mistake and a twist of fate led the youth into a seemingly totally different direction. Will he forget his lifelong goal? Will he instead step back onto his initial path that he fervently pursued?

Content Warning: gore, profanity, sexual content (most of it has been censored) (male/female, female/female, and human/non-human(not for the faint of heart)), traumatizing content
What to expect: Slow story focused on the day-to-day life of a transmigrated man rather than on the plot.
The plot exists but it very slowly becomes relevant.
Also, slow character progress. It's a long journey, so don't expect a hero to grow in just a few chapters.
Detailed environments and extensive world-building.
Realistic and tactical combat instead of flashy.
Protagonist with a cheat but far from overpowered.
Lots of descriptive sex scenes (though most got censored here). It's treated as just another part of life instead of merely fan-service.
A harem where the members actually enjoy living with each other.
Occasional weird wording and grammar, English isn't my first language.

Its sole duty was the protection of civilians and the destruction of Vampires.

Explicit sex (may be referenced, but no NSFW chapters)
Health bars (damage taken and given reflects reality)
Harem 
Gore and ultra-violence

25684,The Triumphs and Tribulations of Kai Jameson,"Kai Jameson is an average everyday young man. He still lives at home with his parents after having just graduated from college. He loves playing video games and his job at the local Buy More is tolerable. Of course that all changes the moment the system arrives and the Earth is connected to the Nexus.
Turns out Kai was trapped in time for about eighteen months while the people already here got a headstart on him. He lucks into being rescued by some people from a town called Donnyton and learns that if he wants to survive in this New Earth he'll have to work harder than ever before. The rewards are worth it.
This is Kai's story, the moments of his triumphs, and the moments when he feels that things couldn't possibly be worse.
Thanks to puddles4263 and his story The Legend of Randidly Ghosthound for the inspiration on the world this is set in. If you have never read that I highly recommend it, and if you have read it and enjoyed that story then I hope you'll enjoy mine as well. This is the first story I'm ever putting out for public consumption so reader beware on that. Any constructive criticism is always appreciated, simply leaving a half star review tells me that you're a moron who doesn't know how to use words. I'm constantly trying to improve my writing and feedback and criticism on what works and what doesn't is the only way to do that at the point I feel I am at. Last, I just marked all the content warnings because you never know where a story will take you and I don't want to exclude anything (though there will never be a harem).
I am going to release 1-2 chapters per week on Fridays. Thanks and enjoy.",29

In his first life, he was a young spartan warrior that was killed for being too weak. 
In his second life, he was a young squire in the courts of Camelot that was tragically killed when his master lost control of his horse, and it kicked him in the head. 
In his third life, he was a child soldier in Africa that managed to escort a group of children to safety before he was shot in the head by their now ex-captors.
And in his fourth life, he spent his entire life in a hospital bed being treated for a currently incurable auto-immune disease.

25699,Magitech Awakenings,"In this world of Terrapia, myth states that Dragons are caretakers of the chaos wheel, a band of energy that encircles the world, penetrating through the very fabric of the dimension.
They tame and convert it, not only to fuel their primal magic, but also to gentler forms that man and beast alike can tap. 
But now they have faded away, being sighted less and less the past couple millennia.
With magic weakening, science has taken root and in many cases merged in a symbiosis with magic.
Guppy Bright, a 17 year old young woman, is a technomancer apprentice living in the bustling city of Nolusburg trying to make ends meet. 
Apprenticed to the enigmatic and somewhat crazy Technomancer Friedrich BrassTuner, she participates in an experiment meant to tap a new rich source of energy. 
However something goes horribly wrong and a rip in the very fabric of reality opens in the workshop, sucking in her mentor and ejecting a dying white dragon. 
The dragon, after examining her, takes a gamble and entwines their souls, an act that causes the dragon, Barthurthalomalew Dresnarian Kratomanger Harrowhew Objuslorow, the 5th, aka Batty, to regress into a baby dragon, sealing much of his powers and memories in the process. 
This act also has profound effects on Guppy, her own magic is now crazily changed in ways no one, least of all her, understands. 
Guppy is suddenly plunged into a world of mystery, intrigue and politics, where everyone either wants to control, or eliminate her. 
Armed with little but her courage and unpredictable newfound magic how will she survive and protect herself and those she loves when everyone from techno radicals, magic purists, politicians and guttersnipes are out to get her. 
And those may be the least of her problems if Batty's fragmented memories are any indicator.",175

25706,Lissanda's Deal,"Author's Note: I am pretty much writing this as writing practise, I fully expect it to suck. I have never published anything on this site before. Critique and feedback is welcome, I'm always interested in improving my works. Oh yeah also if by some cruel twist of fate you actually enjoy reading this, I will not be consistently uploading by any stretch of the imagination and frankly if I get more than four chapters in I will be horrified.
The bit you're actually reading this for: Lissanda deGrave is an average girl, ask anyone. She's pretty, but not head-turning. She's smart, though her own tests will prove she's not exceptional. She's the second daughter of a minor merchant in a less than important corner of the Empire. She's mostly liked by her classmates, and by people in general, but she has never quite fit in with the 'In' crowd. 
Actually, her averageness is probably the reason she's still attending her Third Year Studies of the Arcane at the somewhat prestigious Feltersgate College of Arcanic Arts. In a world where you're surrounded by the children of the most influential nobles and priests within a hundred miles, sometimes being no threat is better than being a weak one. 
You see, it takes more than a little hard work and passing a few exams to make your way in the world of the budding Arcanist. It takes money, or connections, and Lissanda has neither. What she does have is a dusty old spellbook, a knack for forbidden magics, and nothing to lose.",4

What sort of place awaits him in this world full of danger and uncertainty?This world is harsh, not at all the fantasy fluff and harems he'd imagined. Will he be able to keep his sanity with death around every corner?
This story has LGBTQ friendly themes. It touches on drug use, child molestation, rape, children committing murder, death sentencing as a form of punishment, and questioning one's sexual identity. There are some harsh themes, since this is meant to be a harsh world. Some themes touch upon the MC directly, the others happen to secondary characters. I try not to go into too graphic of detail and I believe that this story is 16+ friendly. I promise that these themes tie together in the end to make a cohesive whole and are used to provide back story for later developments.",166

-------------------------------------
Author here! This is my 3rd story on RoyalRoad, the other two having long since been dropped years ago. They were a mess of ideas and had no real substanence to them, leading me to begin hating writing them and eventually just stop writing altogether for about a year and a half. 
Finally, after reading hundreds of thousands of pages of novels, from low fantasy to sci-fi litrpg's to thousands of pages long xianxias, I finally feel ready to write a real story that isn't a cesspool of ideas blended together. I plan to see this out to the end, as I already have the first few major arcs planned out unlike my other stories where I thought of ideas as I wrote. 
This story takes place in a world with a litrpg system, as per tags. This isn't a VRMMO or Reincarnation story. The main character exists in and is from said world. There are some differences from other litrpg's which will be explained in author notes in the few few chapters. 
I plan to publich 6-7 chapters a week, each 2-3k words long. If i fail to do so I will create a back-log I have to eventually make up but as of writing this it's the summer for me so I'll have plenty of time to write.

Ever since its launch, World of Aingarrth allowed players to fulfill their wish. Do you want to be an asshole? Go ahead. Do you want to be a shiny white knight? You do you. Players are free to choose and define themselves in the brand new VRMMORPG.
It takes the world by storm. Not only by how unique the MMORPG is, but also because there is roleplay mode. It allows people to set their own settings, either fantasy towns, schools or even graveyards. Then, choose scenarios that are going to happen, like getting married or saving a princess. They would then play as the main character, and the story adapts to their decision.
Kei, a 29-year-old corner store clerk, decided to try it out. He has enough of his plain boring life, where many people treat him like trash. Each time after work, he would spend hours playing the game, even if it means he must sacrifice his sleep. He sometimes plays the roleplay mode, but he is more attracted to the MMORPG mode
His passion inspires a certain guild leader, who takes him in and makes him his vice. With his help, the guild slowly builds up, until it gets to be the biggest villains guild in the server.

One day, after work, Kei is about to launch the game when he fell asleep.
When he opens his eyes, he is surprised to find himself laying on a pedestal in a tomb.
With a girl kneeling beside him.
He didn't realize he was transported to another world.
Nor that there were others who were transported there too.

Rick West, a wounded Marine with a very unique past is transported, with a significant portion of Earth's population, to a new universe. One that is shattered and yet to coalesce under a divine law. 
This is the story of a military man who begins the saga immature, rough, careless of other’s feelings. A young man whose focus is on getting laid, fighting, and winning at every turn, regardless of cost. He gets caught up in a strange occurrence, along with a billion others, and finds himself in an oddly familiar place where life is lived as a timed-event role-playing game.
He discovers that within the shattered universe he is a Mystic Player, a Marshal, a figure of power, potential, and probability. If he wins, he may even able to wrestle unto himself the very throne of heaven. Rick starts to build his Pantheon with his most trusted companions, friends, family, and a harem of strong and talented women. He faces challenges within himself and others, and also must lead his faction into battle with men and monsters.
As Rick and his companions progress through the adventure games within the pocket universe, he develops a greater understanding of his humanity and the qualities of what makes each of us uniquely valuable. He grows mentally, emotionally, and spiritually, without really noticing how he is leaving his old existence behind.
Striving against him for truly ultimate power are a thousand others with the same potential, the same possibilities. All are aligned on the spectrum from the brightest of minds, the lightest of hearts, to the darkest of souls. All Mystic Players, be they Monster or Marshal, share one characteristic. They thrive in chaos. And a shattered universe is a universe in chaos.
At the end of the Saga, will the winner be someone worthy of emulation and even, if it were appropriate, of worship as an exemplar of divinity.

Nothing to indicate sickness but I know better. She had a parasite stuck to her and I need to rip it way and burn it before it was too late. I couldn’t do it alone and I know mother would be needed as well as nana and her my Aunties. 
Shifting my gaze I glared down at the pirates leaching off of her. It’s name was Chet and he sported bright flaming hair that looked orange most of the times then red. His eyes were always bloodshot and they where this eerie color changing eyes that always has a white light gleaming out of them. He looked at everyone like food to be eaten and things to play with. His skin was a sickly pale color and he looked nothing like mother and my sister. However he looked just like father and every time I came near them I felt sickly. If I stayed around them for too long the beast All of my beast wanted nothing more than to rip them apart and I would start to lose control. Both of them stay away from nana and I do what I can to stick near her as much as possible.

Amber, I will protect you so please hang in there. I laid down on the floor next to mothers bed as I use my telecontact power to bring it closer for me to lay eye level next to her.

Life is Pointless... Yet we all keep going even, knowing that, we trudge through the pointless monotony of existence and the few lucky of us can and will eventually find something truly worth living for, the rest of us poor sods, either have to let simple impulses like ""being a good cog in society"" keep us moving, but some of us don't have a small light to guide us.
All that we have is the abyssal darkness to keep us company, to fill the void and prevent us from imploding in sheer insanity, yet to the rest our reason for existence is to be looked down upon, shunned and destroyed.

Spellcasters (Witches and Wizards)? Bloodsuckers (Vampires)? Or Mortals (Humans)? A few, more than a few, or, miraculously, will he be able to unite all five supernatural Councils (groups) and form an eternal pact that may just last a dozen or so centuries?

It was a time when health was something you buy and most of the people were too poor to care.
And in this era lives a boy named Oliver.
Oliver was just another abandoned orphan, one of the many products of the trying times.
He had the fortune - or misfortune - to be taken in as a servant of the Renfield Household where he spent most of his time
scrubbing shoes, cleaning latrines, and getting buggered and downright abused by the daughter of the household.
Everything seems bleak until he met Crepsley, A self-proclaimed Doctor who insists on having Mad in front of his name.

After the System announces the impending doom of many people, one person blinks.

His luck takes a turn when he gains power from his inventions and that of his coworkers, at the cost of some of his sanity.
The coworkers at his lab force him into a cryogenics capsule, after using him in his brain addled state, in the hopes that he will become useful at a later time but later turns out to be far longer than any of his coworkers would have lived to see.
He awakes, his memories fragmented and his eyes blind, to a world where the science he helped to further and what led to his near death is worshipped as a mysterious force of magic and the cruel experiments he was once subjected to are blessings to the select few that survive or do not get turned into monsters.

They were much better than us humans, agility, strength, even battle sense, they were our superiors with the single mindset to eradicate us as a whole race. With no other options to survive, we were pushed underground as the last resort to survive. The 7 billion in population was drastically reduced to just roughly over 10 000. We could barely kill them with our primitive weaponry, their bodies were practically bulletproof. We were practically on route to complete extermination. Well, as the story goes, at the end of the box, there was also hope. A new type of armament dubbed reapers was created. With it, we killed our first corrupted. The corrupted dropped stones which would be later be dubbed runes. These runes, depending on which one was dropped would strengthen us, humans, even letting us use things akin to magic.

Some of the Yrdkish peerage, and some of those far removed from such status, disagree with Pennat Gate’s position, politics, and rulership. A few are not satisfied merely with seditious talk.

This novel starts off slower than most. If the slow-roll isn't your thing, you might want to give this a pass. If it's not for you, I understand. Also, releases may be broken up into smaller chunks. The goal is 5k words, but definitely more than 4k. If you see a short release, be aware that more is probably coming.
 I'll be honest and say that I'm struggling with each new scene, if only because I want to balance the scope of vision with good pacing. I hope the work I put into it is worthwhile.

Alex was dying, and all the millions his father had left him meant nothing.
The life he had been so eager to embrace, to do the memory of his father proud, would soon come to an end.
Cancer.
That ugly, terrible word.
He had tried to be strong for his mother, even when the treatments left him violently ill, his body wracked with pain, his friends and even his girlfriend leaving him almost as fast as his once impressive physique wasted  to nothing under the ravages of his illness.
And just when he thought all hope was dead, a couple discrete referals placed by high-powered friends of his family got him an exclusive spot at the most sophisticated cryonic facility in the world.
He didn't know if there was such a thing as an afterlife, but part of the package included uploading a copy of his cortex into a digital universe filled countless worlds to explore, where he could embrace whatever class or profession he could dream of.
All of which sounded hell of a lot better than the miserable death waiting for him in the real world.
In the end, he signed the paperwork, putting his pathetic flickering life in the hands of potential quacks and charlatans.
After all, with death just days away, what did he have to lose?
Even if he could never be successfully revived, he could at least adventure his heart out.
(Authors Note: Books 1-6 are now live on Amazon and here is a link if you wanted to check it out!  And I will continue to post chapters to Book 7 here first, until that tale is told! I hope you enjoy! And if you wanted to help support my work by checking out book 1 on Amazon, I would be extremely grateful!)","1,578"

Kiri’s a young dryad sent on a dangerous quest to explore a series of irregular portal openings and earn her place as a Warden, a protector of worlds. A fresh trail leads her to a planet long since abandoned by the dryads and a human soldier putting more than her mission at risk.
Johann’s had his fair share of war, only for life to take on a whole new dimension when a group of mystical nymphs appear on the battlefield. His only hope in escaping the Emerald Forest and returning home lies with the stunning Kiri. She’s keeping him at bay for now, but he’s sure he can break the ice between them in time to defeat the new enemy.
A part of Kiri regrets saving Johann from the clutches of evil nymphs. Not only is he loud and shows a complete lack of respect for the environment, a complete no-go by her books, but he’s also dangerously attractive for a human. Kiri’s heard plenty of stories about falling in love with mortals to know she shouldn’t.",23

It was not until millenniums later when a tribe of elves who worshipped him in the ancient past awoke him. He was awakened into a new era where ten gods who also stripped away the divinity from other gods like him abuse their powers. They ruled the world with tyranny; only keeping some kingdoms and mortals who worship them safe while marginalizing others. 
As it turned out, Awana still has a sliver of his previous powers. Now filled with thoughts of anger and revenge, he plans to create a kingdom of heretics cast away by the gods, revive other fallen gods like him to join forces, and finally kill all of the ruling gods.

Grammar might be messy. Yes, I am a non-native speaker but I'm not trying to use that as an excuse. I am going to try to improve.

However, that all changes when he meets Shigeko Sugawara, a worldhopper. Join Zeir as he embarks on a journey filled with adventure, fantasy and... status windows?
I wrote this story because I wanted to add a slight spin to isekai/transportation stories as we currently know them. Instead of the main character being the one who is transported, he is instead a regular person living in the fantasy world. This story will focus primarily from his point of view although perspectives will change occasionally so I can build the world and story. This will not be your typical isekai story. There will be plenty of tropes you love like training arcs/op characters/unique abilities but I will also keep thinks spicy with unique twists and turns.",3

26007,Welcome to Althesia,"A sudden arrival lands Jonathon Marshall and his granddaughter Skye in a new world. For the first time in their lives, they are unable to think their way out of a problem. Althesia is ""ruled"" by a God named Alty, although he doesn't do much in terms of leading or controlling. His chief objective is to make the world entertaining to himself and grow his power. The actual world of Althesia is a world of contrasts. The rich live lavishly within view of those in the depths of all-encompassing poverty. The great cities that are scattered throughout the land look out upon vast fields, forests, and farmlands scattered with villages and solitary hermits. The powerful run amok and stand tall in front of the weak. On a larger scale, each culture deals with the issues and benefits that arise in a world with clear-cut power differences and class-like occupations. Jon and Skye are brought initially to a society that devised a strict hierarchy based on power. The lower classes here can't fight back against those above them, and the classes in the middle often don't feel the need to. Not all of the world is like this, however, and as you explore Althesia you find a multitude of continents to explore and adventure in. Some of these have even managed to create government systems similar to the democracies of the Marshalls' old world. Althesia is a world of contrasts. Gods meddle, the powerful prey on the weak, and the rich overwhelm the poor. Jon and Skye must not only learn to navigate this dangerous yet beautiful new world, but they must also learn to enter the top tiers of society.
This story is a GameLit/LitRPG novel. That means XP, levels, monsters, skills, rarities, classes, etc exist. It won't be as heavy on those elements as some novels, as I plan to keep the XP earned hidden from the characters to make their world seem more lifelike as opposed to a game. However, it will be going on behind the scenes and controlling the leveling. It does, however, mean there will occasionally be status sheets, although I will do my best to keep them on the rarer side and as small as possible. Therefore, if you hate everything about LitRPG's or Isekai-type stories, Welcome to Althesia is not for you. Otherwise, well, I guess I should say ""Welcome to Althesia!""",1

26085,The Protector,"Elves have been living for thousands of years. Thus far they have only had one queen. She is still reigning after almost 10?000 years. The Elves have a duty to protect and take care of the world tree. The duty was passed down from their creator directly to the Elven queen. With this purpose the Elven kingdom was born. A 1000 years after the creation of the kingdom the primitive kingdom of man came to be. Peace reigned for another Three thousand years until the power hungry Humans made war on the elves wanting to get their hands on the power of the world tree. This would give the humans powers that would shoot them to the top of the food chain. 
The war raged 500 years and the elves dominated the humans in every battle. Though every elf that was killed was a big loss as they had a very low birth rate. Thus the elves retreated completely into their forest. They had an exceptional ability to fight in the forest, and the forest, to the dismay of the humans, fought with the Elves. 
A relatively peaceful era came to pass. The elves did not allow the humans in their forests and they also very rarely left them. The humans tried to establish communication with the elves by building towns close to the forests. But these towns also had an appalling second purpose, they dealt in slaves, and Elven slaves were the most sought after in the entire world as they are exceedingly rare and once enslaved, will be slaves forever. 
The story follows an enslaved Elven girl and her Master, their journeys will take them across the globe with many meetings and partings of different people.

While temporary peace had ensued, signs of inequality would once again begin to sew conflict into their peaceful lives.

Yet, life is all about decisions. Decisions that’s plentiful during one’s life span. Which she’s now about to make for her own sake… or for others as well?

26135,Auntie toasts the VRMMORPG,"~~ On Hiatus ~~

After Flora Fluss burns down the kitchen, her son insists she is too old to live alone. She's got two choices. Either move into a retirement home or spend the rest of her life within a virtual reality game governed by society's most advanced artificial intelligence. When you've worked a lifetime as an engineer for home appliances, naturally, you go with the option that has more toasters. 
Soon, Flora finds out that the virtual world is more familiar than she thought. Though, it takes her a while to get used to the idea that tanks don't hold water or oil but the aggro of mobs.  
Auntie toasts the VRMMORPG contains cute crafting, complicated game-mechanics plus how to exploit them, unconventional training methods, and a lot of toasters.

26149,Skybound,"Skyclad and Skybound have been merged into one fiction on Royal Road.
Back when I first started Skyclad, this function was not available. So when the first book was finished, I started a whole new fiction for book 2. Now that they've got the ability to separate a long series into ""volumes"" built into the site, I asked kanadaj to merge them into one. this should be easier for me to manage from a writing standpoint, and also be easier on readers and their follows/bookmarks list. I was informed earlier this week that there were quite a few people who read Skyclad and had no idea Skybound even existed. This should help reduce the chances of that happening in the future, and hopefully surprise any people who still didn't know there was a book 2 but where still subcribed to notifications for Skyclad.
The next chapter will be going up on monday, and then book 3 will start on Patreon. It's title is Skycrowned, and once i get a buffer of chapters built up i'll resume posting on Royal Road on either a weekly or bi-weekly schedule.
The Skybound chapters can now be found in their proper place over at the page for Skyclad","3,005"

Hence, what he noticed since he was a kid was that to him, getting better scores in school were far more important than hanging out with friends or playing around.
But the expectations his parent placed upon him only grew larger and larger as time went on. And before he knew it, he found their expectations had turned into a shackle that had slowly been tightening around his neck, everything that he did always felt meaningless and he had forgotten when was the last time he laughed.
Though, at the first summer holiday of his high school life, Tsukasa, a normal student who never did anything else besides study, was suddenly transported into another world for no apparent reason.

One night as he leaves later than usual from campus, Yato finds a strange object on the ground-- a black card with just the single number [9] written in reverse. When he inserts it into an ATM, Yato realizes to his surprise that the black card functions as a cash card, holding a sum beyond his wildest imagination----Displayed on the screen is a string of 9s---- [$999,999,999,999]!
What secrets lie within the origin of this black card? Inevitably tumbling into the webs of a yet unseen world, Yato is probably the only one to find out. With a facade that hides his emotions, Yato clutches the black card tightly in hand and takes his first step on this treacherous path.",47

COVER BY SIMON GOINARD",10
26157,Silvergates: Navigator (Book 2 complete),"Five years ago, the first Silvergate was found. At first, they called it a hoax. But since then, more and more people have entered the alternate dimension called Northworld, received their Interface, and going on to real adventures. As it gained momentum, they called it a problem. Now, they call it a crime. But for nearly half a million people, it's now their real home.
Yearning. Escape. Duty. The reasons to go are many. Despite the criminalization of Silvergating, people still seek out their ticket to Northworld.
But for new Gaters Jasper Hill, Erika Haglund, and Henry Esteban, Northworld has surprises in store. Not every rumor is false, not every conspiracy theory is stupid. When the veil lifts for them, showing truths about Northworld that no one suspected, they may have difficulty making themselves heard.
And being trusted may mean the difference between life or exile forever.

Northworld is a litrpg story where people enter an actual world, submit to an RPG-type Interface, and discover an alternate reality. You could describe it as a reversible Isekai since people alternate between Earth and Northworld.
The characters are usually casual about it, which means informal talk and infrequent profanity. Four-letter words dropped in conversation (or internal monologue).
Warning: one potentially horrible theme and one implied sex scene.
Book 1 and 2 are complete, as the title says. Book 3 is scheduled for a fall start.",673

26159,The Final Draft,"This is basically the story of a farmer turning cats loose to wipe out mice that are stealing food.
Except the farmer is an intergalactic empire, the mice are rebels and space pirates, and the cats are randomly chosen humans from present-day Earth.
Margaret was one of the fortunate few to be selected, drafted to fight on an alien planet for overlords she never knew existed. Dropped onto a fantasy world where things like toilets are nonexistent, how does an architect/engineer fight back? By building, of course.",53
26160,The Traveler,"Reincarnated with no information other than a single mysterious message, little Damian must survive as an infant in a world of might and magic. He’d better not get caught possessing his memories, or he might spend a thousand years suffering. 
 Being a baby in another world is weird, disorientating, scary, disgusting, and also heartwarming. It doesn’t just happen for no reason, but the “why?” might be a harder puzzle to solve than conquering the whole entire realm. 
 Both of those eventualities were very remote possibilities for an unusually smart baby. He was more concerned with making it to his first birthday without being damned by the gods or eaten by dangerous monster.",47
26161,Deviled Egg,"Or ""My Downstairs Neighbor Performed a Ton of Demon Heritage Awakening Rituals under my bed, And I woke up as a succubus, but I'm starting to like it?"" 
Peter Donnellan is a regular college student in the far off year of 2089, but when his downstairs neighbor screws up a ritual right under his bed, Peter awakens to a truth about himself he is too scared to admit. 
The worst part is all the supernatural stuff he has to start dealing with now, from Angels to Demons to Fae. And all just as summer begins!",165
26162,The Demon Contract,"Minami Riku is a 22-year-old studying in Tokyo in hopes of getting into a university. However, living alone had made it difficult for him to succeed since he lacked self-discipline. He has no money, no friends and no achievements. Just when he thought his life couldn't get any worse, he gets shot and robbed in the middle of the night.
With death at his doorstep, he is left with no choice but to accept the contract offered by a passing yokai. Live and serve him or die.
Now, in order to get back to his normal life, Riku has to complete all the tasks given to him by his new master. This inevitably results in him getting deeply involved with the world of yokai. Will he ever escape? Follow Riku's adventures to regain his life in a world of myths and legends.
 

 
Is this an isekai? Not really. Riku will still primarily be living in the human world but he is occasionally sent into the demon realm to do the tasks given to him. The premise is simple, if he succeeds in doing all of the tasks given to him, the contract is completed and he gets to go back to being a normal person. If he fails? Well, let's just say university is going to be the least of his worries.
This is going to be an action novel with some litrpg elements. Hmmm? Numbers combined with yokai sounds weird? Well, that's for you to decide after you've read this novel. If all of this sounds interesting to you, please give this a go!",2
26163,I was Born the Unloved Twin,"You've probably heard this sort of story before.
 
Once upon a time, blah blah blah a boy and a girl fell love and everything was beautiful and perfect, except for this thing called life getting in their way. 
He was this cool foreign prince and she was basically perfect. Really it's a very boring run of the mill story. I'll even spoil it for you, they kill the villainess at the end.
Not the type of story I'd read personally.
So where do I fit into this?Apparently I'm her older twin sister and the very very lucky fiance to the foreign prince. You know, the dead villainess? Sucks I know. Now I get to do it all over again from the beginning.Curse my life
 
------
 
So you're somewhat interested in what this thing is about and looking to see if it's even worth reading?
 
Let's get the worst of it out of the way first: This is a boring story, very tedious, mundane and downright just boring. It's too slow, the characters are too confusing & make possibly retarded choices. It's an isekai/reborn type Slice of Life novel that plays on the villainess noble girl trope but the MC gets no OP cheats, no magical powers, not even some satisfying face slapping or such self-fulfillment fantasy. Wow, I'm doing a terrible job advertising this thing.
If you're somehow still interested, if you were ever interested how an average modern person, reborn with all their host's memories,  could live out their life in this situation, mending personal relationships one step at a time,  or wondered what happened in between all the time skips in other novels, maybe give Unloved Twin a try. 
This is an awkward novel, the pacing is slow, and there is no time skips. For some reason still, I really love this little story I'm making.

26164,The Legend of Black Eyes,"Zedd Darkstar, also known as Black Eyes, is a man with a plan. In the planet of Hera, he's the only man willing to take down the Auruun Empire that threatens to put an end to the Magic Era.
A powerful warrior and an excellent strategist, Zedd plans to slowly weaken the Empire until the day of the final showdown. The only setback? Zedd is extremely unlucky. Whatever he touches turns to dust.
During his quest to bring the Empire down, Black Eyes fights his curse along with the multiple superpowers that threaten to destroy all his plans.",157
26165,Gamble,"My name is Vak Tychus. Aside from the, regrettably striking name, there were very few things I'd judge, that made me - me. The name had to do with chance or fate. My last name was Latin, derived from the Latinized name Eutychus which was the combination of two Greek words corresponding to ""good"" and ""luck, chance, and fortune."" 
Now that you know why I'm so unhealthily and exceedingly prone to gambling I can begin to teach you why exactly I love it so much. 
There's a handful of things you'd have to know to really appreciate how to gamble. You'd be surprised at how much you can learn in two decades supposing you stuck with it your entire life. Although, there are some stark differences between betting a handful of cash and your life against monstrous creatures intent on your blood. Well, you learn a thing or two, if you can believe it.
Here, in fact, we can start with the first one: Taking a risk.

26167,Shattered Souls,"The world of Yera is alive more so than ever, inhabited by many races intertwined together. Several kingdoms and empires each vying for power. Creatures that roam the planet some bloodthirsty and mindless, others ancient and wise. The magic powerful, ethereal, and dangerous. Many forces move on this planet that seems so large, yet above our own skyies there are the beings who see this world as a small fraction of existence.
We focus in on our 'hero'. Waking lost and confused, he doesn't even know who he is much less his own place in the world. Still, all he can do is gather himself to his feet and walk forward and forge himself a place.",5
26168,Veins,This story focuses on a person who seeks to find every he lost due to the factory experiments.,1
26169,Purple Flames,"Annabelle Lee thought she had a foolproof plan. She would activate the alien mothership's self-destruct, act like she was making a heroic sacrifice, then use her powers to create a wormhole to escape at the last second. As much as she wanted to be remembered as the Hero of Earth, she also wanted to survive.
But instead of arriving back on Earth as planned, she somehow ended up in a prison cell in the distant world of Garnoth. And as soon as she blasted her way out, she was drawn into a fight between a desperate Resistance and the power-hungry arch-mage Daraken. And they weren't the only forces interested in her unknown power...

She's always been a bit of a misfit, no matter the environment.
Apparently that’s just the way she is, and always will be.
But then Ariah meets her best friend Sudus, and suddenly they can both recall everything from a past life that occurred centuries ago, and Ariah just doesn't know who she is anymore.
However, it wasn't only Sundus whom she befriended so many centuries ago; there were three more people that made up their impromptu family, bound by love rather than blood, and they need to find them in order to be complete.
Together, Ariah and Sundus go on an adventure of self discovery, trying to find out just who they are; are they still those same two girls fate so heinously plunged into adulthood to cure a world full of knights and dragons, or are they two college girls who are just trying to pass their major?",0
26194,Born of Darkness,"Prologue
 
Nearly three centuries ago, a silver-black liquid began pooling into various little lakes and ponds around the world.  If someone saw it, they would describe it as silvery-black, as it is really neither of these colors, but a new one entirely.  Imagine a deep, thick blackness that shimmers with a silvery radiance.  Over time this liquid hardens and turns into a metal-like substance.  Everyone, from bondsmen to wealthy noblemen, often speculate where this liquid might have come from, but nobody really knew, for in the time that these lakes amalgamated it neither rained nor snowed in all of the world.  Some said that one god or another had blessed the world with this liquid, but nobody quite knew for sure.  Even in the last few decades, with all the advancements this strange viscous liquid has brought to the world, not a one person understood it fully.
The liquid is called Tenebris, and it brings magic with it.  The respected leaders of all the great peoples debated on what to call the liquid when it first made itself known.  Most thought it was a godly liquid, and therefore their gods must have already given it a name, and to give it another was to insult these gods.  Eventually, they all agreed that it was unlikely that a god would send a letter telling the peoples of its great name and decided to name it for themselves.  They named it Tenebris, a word from a most ancient respected tongue, which in the common language closely translates as Darkness.

But where we lay down our foundations in their world, they snuff out our light with their vines and tendrils. 
And with The Jhar Empyrean and other space-faring empires keeping their borders tight, we have nowhere else to expand to.

The Kingdom of Abrune regulates it, the church of the Sacred Hierarchies outright condemns it, but one 'wildman' from across the sea begins his journey after being cursed by it.

She enjoys a peaceful life within the garden with her flowers and companions, but others not so peaceful seek to invade her sanctuary.Author's notes:To alleviate any confusion, our main character doesn't have much use for spoken words. Sure, she could probably speak if she tried... but speaking is pretty inefficient compared to how Faerie and those of her garden communicate.
The characters will at some point get actual names, but with no one speaking, it doesn't make sense to me for them to have names yet, especially with each character being more or less unique within the garden.

A dark fantasy where magic is not granted, the knowledge of the forbidden arts are a treasure of the strongest powers and the scent of death lurks at every corner.
Disclaimer:
This is not a cultivation story although it may have some elements of one. This is also not a reincarnation story (mostly). Magic is more abstract until way further in the story and fireballs are not launched after a few days of 'cultivation'.

This new world was different. People could do magic. And there were monsters. 
And what about me? I had mana as well, silver mana. Which no one else seemed to have. The only problem was, I did not know what to do with it.
Until I really needed to. 
 
Author's note: This is the rewrite of Silver Mana. The first bunch of chapters (until I will have caught up to level 2 of the dungeon) should be quite familiar to people that have read the original. There are some changes in content, but the story follows the original fairly closely for at least the first 150-200 pages. Most of the changes are in the writing, and some of the details of how things work. A few of the side characters get a bit more attention too.
 
Some general comments to avoid disappointment:
1. The MC likes to swear. If you object to reading the word ""fuck"" at least once and usually multiple times each chapter don't read the book. ""Fuck"" is such a great, allencompassing word... fuck that; what the fuck?; fuck me! Fuck! one word, expressing so many nuances. And, frankly, the people I know that use fuck as a swear word.. they often use it a lot. 
2. If you are looking for immediate progression, rapid advancement of the story, etc.... read another book. This one takes a bit.
3. I am NOT Pirateaba (who is writing The Wandering Inn) or anyone close to that level of productivity. If you expect to read 10k words every 3 days, or even just once a week... sorry. I've got a busy life. This is for fun, I have no patreon, paypal, anything, so I write when it is fun and however much is fun. Not more. And sometimes that turns out to be a decent amount, sometimes nothing. I have another book (Marrow) so that complicated things - basically I switch between the two whenever the muse strikes me.","1,997"

This is a story in a fantasy world with lots of fantastical elements, including magic and cultivation. However, there's also some decent technology in this world. Gaining power has a system and nothing comes out of nowhere. 
Essentially, the setting and background is high fantasy but the focus will be whatever the MC sees, so expect more of a gritty realistic low fantasy most of the time. The MC is not OP and uses his wits and strategy to survive, and maybe even thrive.
The warning tags are just there because I don't want any limits to where this story may lead me to writing.

To be honest, I'm a bit afraid to post this novel here in Royal Road. English is not my first language and I've heard that the readers here in RR hates horrible grammar and sentence structure the most. However, as a writer, I want to ovecome my fears and improve my writing style. I apologize in advance because you might have the urge to stab your eyes in reading my story that is riddled with so many writing mistakes. 
Feel free to point them out so I can improve.
Feel free to roast me, but I want you to know that I have a fragile heart (Please show mercy!)
And hopefully,  with your help I will become a better writer and show you a story that will make you say...
""Mmm, the cringe is real.""

The only things standing in my way are nature itself, a bunch of strange floating boxes, and a group of crazy powerful creatures known as the forest queens. Sounds pretty simple right?

Also apparently my enemies aren't only inside the forest. Forces from the outside got news that somthing was going down in my new home and are coming to crash my party. Can I claim this forest? Can I protect it? And most importantly can I figure out who I am and what's going on? I'm not sure but I'm going to try.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hey everyone I'm fairly new to writing novles and this is my first time ever putting my work on a site like this one. I hope you enjoy the story and would appreciate your feedback. I would ask that you read through at least a couple of chapters before leaving a rating. I know I have some trouble with grammer and how I structure some of my sentences and while feedback on that is appreciated what I would value most is feedback on the story as a whole in terms of how the plot works and if you are enjoying it or not.

26387,These Games We Play,"When first contact was made, it wasn’t through some observatory. It wasn’t through some interstellar colonization ship. It wasn’t even through some kind of flying saucer landing on the White House lawn.
It was through Node Sol-3, which landed in the middle of Alaska. It connected us to the Simulation, a galaxy-spanning VRMMO.
It goes by many names, of course - The Game, the Dimension, the Tree - I think the Reilans have a word for it that, roughly translated, goes like ‘Second Life and Rebirth in the Dreamworld of the Ancestors’. 
Some kid, Charles Notley, was the first to find it.
People crowded around Notley in the years that followed. After all, being User One meant he had early access to everything. He runs one of the largest Human guilds now. He’s got a movie, a book deal, and the largest stream on planet Earth.
Not me, though. I wasn’t in it for the fame. I just wanted to play the game.

But as his consciousness faded away under the hands of the same heroes he believed in, was his dream at all a reality? 
In this world of summoned heroes…what was the truth?",7
26392,Living the Great Sage Life with my Fairies and Lovers in a New World,"*Currently on hiatus*
*This is a slow burn harem story. The beginning is fairly light, with suggestive content picking up in later chapters. All characters participating in explicit content are 18 years of age, or older. Said explicit content has been toned down and euphemized to meet site regulations, check this story out on other platforms for the uncut version.*
An American IT with a passion for magic and fantasy died on his 39th birthday as a virgin due to a stab to the gut while protecting a coworker of his. He might as well died a 'Wizard' that needed one more year to become a 'Sage.'
Then, like in recent isekais, he was reincarnated in a new world as Soar Osmis with memories of his past life intact. This new magical world of Manara is where everyone has a chance to become an aspiring Magician, be blessed with powers by forming contracts with fairies as Chaperone and Companion, and special abilities called 'gifts,' and it just so happened that Soar was given the 'Wizard' gift at birth.
Thus, began the mostly slice-of-life harem isekai story of a man reincarnated in a world centering around the very thing he loved: magic, as he trained and used the knowledge from his past life to carve a path to a new one on his own terms while growing as a 'Great Sage.'
Some RPG game mechanics applied with a growing OP MC with humans and demi-humans as love interests. Profanity and little gory violence is included, characters in explicit sex scenes are at and above the legal age (MC won't have such scenes until his new body is around that age). Some scenes include yuri (F X F).

Mana though useful for enhancing the body isn’t unlimited, and humanity fell behind fast.
From experiments, a being of mana, born into this chaotic world. The first of its kind. Rather than thriving in a world to which it belongs, it has to model the world so it will suit its needs.
As a lone being, it has to use its power over mana to influence beasts and humans alike to abide by its will and further its goals. It will manipulate intelligent lifeforms to do its bidding while believing that they are becoming stronger. It will help lower lifeforms and guide their lives until they fit into the world as envisioned by our being.
Read how our protagonist starts in a small area, changing it to suit its needs, and then grows until the world is balanced and at peace again.
 
This is my first story, and I don’t have an editor yet. My English should be good enough, but I expect to have to go back and do editing later on.
I would classify this story as litRPG. There will be a type of system with blue boxes and all, though the perspective is the system itself and how it came to be and why it does what it does. As a single mighty being, there will be dungeon core influences such as expanding the area and influencing all within though there is no such thing as an actual dungeon. As humanity is trying to survive, there will also be some city/base building influences, and I will have some perspective changes to show how the forces are being perceived by the affected people.
As I have a busy job, it will be hard to update consistently, but I am quite a bit ahead of what I have currently uploaded.",52

26419,Death Galaxy,"When portals opened across the world and space, people were a bit terrified. Naturally, some people called it the end times or some other negative interpretation. Thankfully, the new arrivals managed to calm the masses, saying they were here from across dimensions in search of peaceful refuge. After some discussion and promise from the reality hopers to not break the world, they were allowed asylum. 
And so, began a technological revolution as the new cohabitants, who looked distinctly human if a bit off, openly shared some of their knowledge with us. Space travel, while not cakewalks, become more easily accessible, as did interplanetary colonization. Naturally, with the New Humans keeping some of the more dangerous techs to themselves and Old Humans being a greedy bunch, tensions are arising as old and new grudges rear their ugly heads. The world endlessly spins as history, both good and bad, is seemingly on its way to repeating itself. Only with other planets, and potentially other universes, being the backdrop this time. 
But that was big stuff that Alex had no real interest in. They only care about one thing and one thing. TDAG. Trans-Dimensional Adventure Games. Best VR system ever made. Alex, instead of focusing on political and multiverse shenanigans, had their eyes set on VR games.

In this world where a combat droid, regardless of its ethics, would be considered a ‘low class threat’ (a being that whilst not something to be hunted down, should still be killed on sight)how wil 5T3V-3N82 or Steven, as he likes to be called survive in a world of myths and legends.

This system has a skill for everything and even different approaches for some skills. Instead of levels, he tells them, each skill has its own experience and level.
""As true to real life as a gaming system could be."" at least it says on the box. When the group finally break down and decide to play it, they head over to Hunter's house to start. Next thing they know... trapped in the game.
Everyone dreams of being trapped inside their favorite game. Abusing the mechanics and becoming OP AF. No one ever dreams of being trapped in a crappy system. One ladened with rules and so much record keeping it almost becomes tedious.
 
Author Notes: 
Note: There is two different versions of this story, one with the game mechanics and dice rolls(this one) and one without.

26426,The Solstice Wars,"In the grey-cloaked cityscape of modern London, student William Whiteswift has two secrets: the Fae walk among humanity, and they are just as vulnerable as us. His childhood was filled with them; they spawned nightmares and episodes, dreams and obsessions. The nightmares remain, of course, but the fae are his normal. Now, he heals them, for William is gifted. 
When he saves a faerie -- a humanoid fae -- from an injury he can’t explain, William is forced to let her stay. Finally, he may have taken on more than he can handle; Ainsel could uproot his life in seconds. Instead, she cracks a Pandora’s box of mysteries: someone just flipped her home on its head. And because of that, she did something unspeakable. And somehow, she doesn’t want to hurt him. The longer she stays, though, the crueler his nightmares grow. 
Worse, governments hide secrets, too: they know of faeries. To them, all fae are monsters fueled by solstices and equinoxes. As the autumn equinox approaches, the culling agency COURT hurries to track Ainsel down. With teams across the United Kingdom and Ireland -- iron-strong despite the region’s history -- they are nearing success. A world away, their country wounded, the faerie leaders hunger for justice. 
In the looming shadows of war and of Ainsel’s mistake, can a human and a faerie protect each other against their own kind? Could their plight mend rifts between bitter nations and bitterer people? Or will it, like past attempts at peace, shatter?

26436,Chronicles of Xod (returning from hiatus),"After a long recovery over a chronic motion sickness issue, I feel I'm ready to return to writing this book. It might be slow at first, but I'm hoping to pick up where I left off. I apologize again for the long hiatus.

The pages following are a true account. An account of how I, Josh--a teenage nerd from modern suburbia--ended up in a strange world filled with fantastic magic, bizarre creatures, and terrifying dungeons. Despite the troped-up fantasy feel of the world, this is hardly an ordinary tale. For one, don’t expect a happy ending. With the trials I’ve been through, the horrors I’ve seen and the atrocities I’ve committed, believe me when I tell you, this is not a happy tale filled with friendly rainbow bears or teenage flying unicorns. It’s more likely you’ll finish this book mentally scarred as I will not spare the details of my unfortunate adventures.
With the help of my trusted companion Gui, I gain an insight that no one else in the world has. This knowledge allows me to exploit and, for lack of a better term, metagame the system which gave me a clear advantage over its residents. “With great power...,” someone might begin to quote to me. In my defense, I think maybe even you, reader, might have acted similarly with how this reality changed my view of good and evil.

This story will be updated regularly on Wednesdays around 6 PM. There will only be about 1000 words per update.
The focus is to finish the story before doing any major changes or editing. Please read as if this is a work in progress, not a finished product.
Feel free to let me know if you see any error, whether glaring or minor. If you help me out, I'll be sure to add you to a thank you list at the front of the book when it is published.

Chronicles of Xod is a first-person fantasy novel that follows the adventures of a young man from Earth. Through unknown circumstances, he finds himself in a fantasy world where life is not all wonders and happy endings. The story takes common fantasy concepts from my favorite video games, books and movies and gives them an adult edge. It also introduces some taboo concepts often glossed over by stories written for broad audiences.
The style is meant to be immersive and heavily detailed.
The short novel will be written in a way that attempts to bring a sense of realism to an unrealistic genre. Where there are realistic consequences and dangers in a world populated with violent monsters, cruel demons, bloodthirsty undead, and immoral bandits.
In this fantasy world, the inhabitants are essentially gender blind as far as sexuality is concerned. There is also more variation amongst male and female physiology. This isn't meant to be any kind of promotion or demotion of social behavior in reality. Just a concept I thought would be an interesting idea to have in a fantasy setting.
I highly discourage anyone from reading this material if you are personally concerned with being offended or traumatized. Both violent and sexual content will be graphically detailed.
All characters involved in sexual scenes are mature and of the age of consent(18+).",23

I suppose answers will come in time, but first we need to survive and it's not like the people who picked out the planet to land on made that easy for us.

She failed seven times and traveled to six different worlds, each of them in a different period but still like a game.

But as the least advanced race in the galaxy, the Earthians are struggling to carve a niche for themselves, made all the more difficult by the fact that they are the only race in the entire galaxy incapable of developing supernatural powers.
Until recently.
Few know how or why, but small groups of Earthians have begun to display superhuman abilities — and the militaries of the galaxy have begun to display interest in them.

On a side note, I am curently re-editing the first half of the story. So, you might see grammer mistakes. I am working on fixing the problems, if you can push through to the chapter thirty-five ish the grammer improves alot becuase White Wind has been editing my mistakes.","5,316"

26584,The Traveler,"Reincarnated with no information other than a single mysterious message, little Damian must survive as an infant in a world of might and magic. He’d better not get caught possessing his memories, or he might spend a thousand years suffering. 
 Being a baby in another world is weird, disorientating, scary, disgusting, and also heartwarming. It doesn’t just happen for no reason, but the “why?” might be a harder puzzle to solve than conquering the whole entire realm.

Now noticing the tickling feeling on his nose and the unusual hardness of his “mattress”, the figure starts to awaken. “What’s go-“opening its eyes the figure was about to shout out in frustration, but as soon as its brain registered what was actually in front of him, well lets just say it was a bit of a shock.",4

Oh, and then there's this gorgeous alien woman who he probably shouldn’t trust at all.  
His plan is to find a way home to Earth, even if its unlikely to be remotely the same; to find a better class of companions among an often strange and inexplicable galactic community, at least one who won’t use him or sell him out at the first opportunity; and to do something about the parasites in his brain who are supposed to connect him to a library the size of the galaxy, but seem to only be telling him that almost everyone and everything he comes across wants to kill him.

What could be strong and powerful enough to contend with that which gives humans peace of mind and clarity as well as giving man the ability to realize the very workings of the universe by connecting the mind, body, and soul?
Miasma. It is a vile darkness that all cultivators shed when they start on their path to cultivation.

After his withdrawal from Space Forces, in which he has spent twenty years, Captain Sava Gromov desires an extra reason for his existence. With a vague idea of becoming a merchant, he buys a secondhand spacecraft, loads the cargo, and leaves for an adventurous journey through the Solar System.
On his way, he receives an SOS coming from a damaged research spaceship. Rescuing the crew in a crisis is the easier part; the harder part comes afterward. The research team discovered an abandoned weapon, originating from a forgotten empire. Unfortunately, not everyone considers the vanished empire harmless. There is an organization actively destroying its remnants.
Only two choices remain for Gromov: either to die or operate the unknown weapon in a slight hope that the archaic device may deter his pursuers. Choosing the latter, Gromov assimilates with an inhuman digital being into the ultimate symbiosis of the organic and digital world.
The Universe turns out to be a dangerous place: full of conflicts, threatening aliens, and unpredictable twists. The unmanageable chaos dwells in desperate need of a unifying force.
Will Gromov become the Sovereign of the Solar System? Will he become the ultimate enemy of humankind?

26625,Draugr Cell  //Layer 01-- Investiture:,"With the end of the only war to ever reach mainland Australia I found myself living out of a small room in an old military compound that had been handed over to the jurisdiction of the Department of Veterans Affairs.  The end of the war, unfortunately, didn't mean the end of hostilities.  The terrorism trend that had started back in the early 2000's with the attack on the world trade center over in America, had spread to just about every country on the face of the planet.  Over time the constant threat from various groups meant the civilian police force was quickly undermanned, under equipped, and overwhelmed.  They were simply unable to respond to the daily threats in any reasonable time frame, and in many situations lacked the both the skills and equipment required to deal with the threats to put them down in a 'safe' and expedient manner.
Veterans of the war that were being reintegrated into society however, were just about everywhere, all the time. We have the training and the skills required to deal with just about any threat you care to mention, all we needed was access to the equipment to do so.
In a world first, under the new Veterans program, the Australian government had taken the rather controversial step of allowing specifically selected veterans to go armed in public. Sure, with Australian weapons laws being very, very strict there were a number of hurdles to get over first, but that's where the selection part comes in. Tangentially that's actually how I met Brianna, my current partner.
We work as ringers in Victory City, I thought being thrown into imptomtu combat operations and risking my life on a daily basis for barely livable wages was excitement enough.  Then I met her... it... I don't know.  An AI unlike anything else out there has wedged itself into my life and decided it needs to... look after me.  What could possibly go wrong?

[Progress of Rewrite (as of April 2023):~95% of wordcount on RR; ~30% of content on RR]
Synopsis:
Fate has plans for everyone. There are many paths one can walk and many nodes one can unlock. Yet all mortal souls only start with one node. This has been the case for many years and while there are some records of people with more than one first node, these are as rare as wings on snails, roses made of air, or ropes made of dragon-hair.
Elise Anker has two first nodes. She doesn't know why and the only one that could answer is an angry voice in her head. She hears it rarely and the voice is as helpful as a sword is effective against a Leviathan.
She strives to become a mage, a knight or maybe something else entirely. The future is uncertain and unless she finds out what her nodes mean, she will never know what she wants to become. But her nodes won't unlock and the angry voice tells her that she needs to find a worthy foe to kill.

I’ve made a story board with ideas for a good portion of the novel already, I do not plan on having voting decide the course of the novels’ story but I am willing to change my novels’ story as it develops and critiques and comments come in on the quality of it. Constructive criticism is welcomed, thank you for taking a look at my novel.

26652,The Shadow Paradigm - Book 1: Project Orb Weaver,"Gardening, cooking, innovation, preservation, charity events... Madzistrale, Tom and Gabzryel does it all. But when they encounter the mysterious Shiakar Paradigm Society, a clash of paradigms ensues. Although both groups are aiming to make humanity stand stronger, their ideals and methods could not be further apart. Between the trio's optimistic yet naive ideals, and the SPS's tried-and-true surgical methods, determining the answer which methods can better humanity is a struggle that both parties must resolve in their own ways...
Welcome to the final revision of my 10+ years ongoing novel trilogy. This revision took out some flawed plot concepts to re-introduce a more down-to-earth, film noir-like ambience, where a battle of wits is what will determine the outcome. It also added instead more in-depth expansion into the lives and mindsets of the characters, especially the heroes (a missing factor in older versions). Third-view limited storytelling was also introduced more prominently over my favoured third-view omnipotent, with each chapters concentrating as much as possible on a single character's point of view instead of head-hopping.
The chapters here are now as closely finished as I can make them without professional help. They will be updated slowly from the existing 7th revision version, so please be patient.
Meanwhile, if you wish, you can download the full free PDF ebook from my website:https://melodierivers.weebly.com/the-shadow-paradigm-novels.html
As always, I welcome your comments and critiques, and I hope you enjoy reading that story as much as I did creating it!
A parting song to introduce the story: 
Under neon lights, we claim this townNo one can take us down, no, not tonightCity boys and city girls, runnin' wild
Burning like a fallin' starGolden stardust, that's what we areYoung voices carry onCome together in the same ole song
We're still hereWe're shadows fallingThe night is calling againWe're still hereWhere love is runningThe night is calling, again
Brother to Brother
Another night, another townWalking my heart aroundSame old choices, againLike so many tears in the rainWill they remember your nameYoung hearts reach fearlessly, in the night
We're still hereWe're shadows fallingThe night is calling againWe're still hereWhere love is runningThe night is calling, again
Sister to Sister
We're all togetherYou know, I careWe are, we will, always be together
We're still hereWe're shadows fallingThe night is calling againWe're still hereWhere love is runningThe night is calling, again

26656,Paternum: A Superhero Story,"When Quinn finds an experimental superpower-granting costume in their parents’ attic, they didn’t expect to be drawn into a web of superhuman intrigue, but their discovery serves as the catalyst for that conspiracy to slowly unravel.
At it’s heart, Paternum is an extended coming-of-age story for the main character as they become a superhero, in a world with more reasonable stakes and less powerful heroes than many superheroic worlds. Themes include what art means to different people, and what it means to be a patron, whether as a sponsor, a parent, or a supporter.
I consider Paternum‘s primary influences to be the various versions of Spider-Man, J. C. McCrae’s own superhero story Worm, and Drew Hayes’ story SuperPowereds. I hope that fans of such stories can find something to enjoy in mine as well.
Paternum is primarily hosted on my website (thevoidwrites.com) where it updates weekly in groups of scenes totalling approximately 2000 words. Here on Royal Road, it will update once daily with one scene at a time, but only after each act is completed on the home site - the next batch of updates is scheduled to begin on February 5th. There is a discord channel for discussion (discordapp.com/invite/QFMM6yA), and you can vote for Paternum on topwebfiction (topwebfiction.com/vote.php?for=paternum) as well. Finally, you can buy the first book of Paternum, The Swift Uplifting Rush, in a couple different ways - as an ebook through Amazon, or directly from me for a discounted price, or as a physical paperback from Amazon. Buying the book will give you access to Drawing Hands, an exclusive arc that won't ever be published on either my site or Royal Road.",85

The city of Kindlewich entices everyone with promises of riches and happiness. It harbors supernaturals with unimaginable powers while the masses remain ignorant. The strong prey on the weak and the weak exploit each other.

Full Blurb:
Dying while trying to save a young girl's life during a store robbery, Jeremiah, a middle-aged former soldier who fought hard to find peace and happiness in the wake of the aftermath of a bloody and universal-scale war, finds himself the victim of a suspect paperwork mix up in the afterlife.
Told that he won't be able to be reunited with his wife and daughters even after death, at least until the issue is resolved, he is given the chance to enter the litRPG world of Arden to pass his time.
Having found solace in the full-dive reality games of the future, Jeremiah reluctantly agrees, but he soon finds that this world is no game. Born with a low Luck stat, our hero is thrust into the middle of the reality spanning machinations of an outer god-like entity known only as The Corruptor.
As the bleak truth of the new and harsh world sets in, he will have to fight for every inch of ground he's given, but if there's one thing an old soldier knows how to do... it's to close with and destroy the enemy.
Determined to find the same peace he once did in his birth universe, Jeremiah and his family, both newly given as he's born into Arden and freely chosen as he fights his way through it, will struggle against dragons, demons, and Fate herself--along with much worse entities--to claim a lasting happiness of their own.",695

I will be portraying a lot of the characters from the original story in a vastly different or overexagarated manner compared to how they are seen in the official harry potter books.

Unbeknownst to them, an army trained in the blaze of endless conflict sets forth to foil their plans. If only the eastern frontline didn't require over a million man strong force to be maintained!
When everyone is aiming at everyone's throat, great schemes are changing the power balance between the powerhouses, one can only look to improve his own situation. When rulers are sending fathers and sons to battles, daughters and mothers whore themselves to afford another handful of wheat. Only the strong can prevail? All of them either died in the past battles or are enjoying the benefits of the jungle law.

The ultimate prize? The winner of the contest gets to become God of this new fantasy world, and reshape it however they can possibly imagine! The downside? Whichever one of them loses ceases to exist!
For Jack, a clueless, fantasy-obsessed shut-in, picking option number two wasn't hard.

But people are still people, even in a world where a person can get tangible rewards for carrying forth the will of the gods. That makes it even worse, actually: just as somebody with personal power can obtain political power, so can somebody with political power obtain personal power. Thanks to a weird quest from his father's past, a greedy baron and a heap of intentionally misinterpreted evidence, Amarion Pozen gets a front row seat to the execution of what was left of his family and tickets to a one-year long tour of the baron's prison.
But the gods work in mysterious ways. While the nobles of the Holy Alliance are busy stabbing each other in the back, a civil war is starting in the east, possibly signaling the rise of a new row of tyrants. Between the crusaders, who see the world in black and white, the races of evil, who fight amongst themselves, the unknown threats just beyond the horizon, and a pair of observers even more dangerous than the gods, a new age of strife is bewing. But all that is very far away from Amarion, currently sitting in a poorly designed prison.
Or is it? Will the mortals manage to avoid doom once more, or will they have to pick up the scattered pieces of the world afterward?

9 February 2022 Update:
Welcome to the companion short story compilation of my novel trilogy The Shadow Paradigm. This compilation features prequels, sidequels and sequels to the novel's major plotline, as well as featuring a wide range of characters, new and recurring. Prior knowledge of the novel is not necessary as the Orb Weaver Chronicles' short stories are standalone.
Once called The Arkesyyan Chronicles, I've deleted quite a few of its old stories. Due to the new avenue and revision, oriented toward more mystery and film-noir ambience, that I took my stories into, I've removed all aliens and overly sci-fi aspects of the whole TSP lineup, so I've updated the Orb Weaver Chronicles accordingly. 
I hope you enjoy them, and in time, a revised version will also be updated.",2

Life’s tough when you’re an old man trapped in an eight-year old body on another world.

The people of Zürtzün felt deep bitterness towards their former enemies and intense anger towards their King, who they felt had betrayed them by dragging them into a war they didn't want to be a part of. The drastically falling popularity of the King marked the beginning of a war fought within the Imperial capital of Zürtzün, a war of deception and political intrigue with many different parties vying for power in the face of the King's decline. But one party proved to be more ruthless than the rest.
The Adlerschrank emerged a powerful party and wiped off almost all their opponents right off the map. They seized control of the Imperial capital and the rest of Zürtzün, placing their leader, the Herrscher, at the top position of power. He was charismatic and passionate and the people of the Empire came to adore him more than they ever did their King. With his dangerous fanaticism, he won them over.
He promised them wealth. He promised them power. He promised them vengeance.
He promised them a war, one where the Empire would reestablish itself and crush its enemies.
With the eastern lowlands under their iron grip and the ever-growing wariness from their snow-laden neighbour, Myromnmiat, the Empire and its cohorts are left at a crossroads. Is it finally to reclaim the Empire's lost glory? Or will war make the mighty Zürtzün draw it's last breath?
But deep in the heart of the nation, a poison is brewing. The Opera house, the enforcers of the Herrscher's rule and the exterminators of the Empire's ""pests"", has been neglected and left to rot.

We shall pretend that it is a meta artistic choice but the reality is that Mr. Faust is bad at coming up with titles, and since starting This Book back in 2015 as a NaNoWriMo project he could never come up with a good one.
This Book’s genre is YA Supernatural, but that’s only as helpful as any genre tag (IE: not very) so I shall describe it further. This Book is primarily about reincarnation, but it also features mythical creatures such as angels (known here as Seraphs), demons, Byzantines, as well as homeschoolers. Two mythical homeschoolers in fact make up the main characters of this work, a pair of siblings named Grayson and Kish. They live in metro Atlanta in the year 2019 AD with their Aunt. On one particular day they are plunged into a rabbit hole of spiritual and metaphysical politics by the arrival of a mysterious one-eyed Green haired woman and strange humanoid creatures into their lives. That is where the story begins. Yes.

26777,Vitae Memorandum,"First Book of the Mind - Celesi Veil Trilogy
A Remembrance of one's Life, or a Life of one's Remembrance, four girls from different corners of a fantasy world's upper society are suddenly faced with memories of earth. A story of another world, these four girls, awakened to memories of another life, now have twice the trouble to worry about, as they work to discover the truth hidden behind the cause.

As this story was inspired by the act of language translation, the story does feature a new world with a multitude of foreign concepts, one being a brand new language with a completely unique phonetic style.  There is in fact two new very similar languages, both Izhaethyx and Elaethyx (the language of humans and elves, though “izh” translates close to “normal”, because humans are like that).  Related to both languages (both have the same phonetic style, just different sentence structures and words), most Q-sounds are like a windy k-sound, so like Qicir is Kweas-ir… and might actually sound like sounds from a certain fantasy bird from a certain fantasy series now that I think about it (Yes, there are popculture gaming references everywhere in this story).  Qtehlatys is then a quick hard K-and-t whistle, with no real feeling of a vowel between (like you are blowing on your tongue), with then a tongue roll, and a “layth-S” (hard s-ending), like it was two syllables, sorta three with that sudden S (human family names tend to end in a sudden hard sound, elven ones are generally softer and drawn out at the end).  Wyxir phonetically sounds like you’re trying to say wyvern and weather at the same time (similar idea on their royal family’s last name).  Considering that Qictae and Wyxtae are effectively Eastward and Westward, neither name are actually very creative to the locals.  Possibly suspicious by now, they have no o-sound at all, and there are plenty of y-forms.  Elaethyx also originally co-opted a lot of Izhaethyx words because their language never bothered with anything outside their cultures (still being as related to each other as earth’s Latin-based language variants.. so not much really).  Hopefully, the other names aren’t as insane to phonetic for people.  This is also only phonetics, lets not even start on their writing systems.  This should be enough to get a reader started, after all.
This story does not sustain a static flow, it begins with four prelude chapters, and then things start to happen.  From there, everything will develop and evolve overtime.  This is both important for consideration in material so that a reader can understand if this is a good read for them, and to note that not every tag or genre matching this story will be in effect at the start of the story.  In the same context of story evolution, the tag ""Reincarnation"" is actually heavily questioned, one of the biggest questions of the story is if it is a matter of reincarnation, or of getting the memories of another.  The tag has been included only because of this matter of uncertainty, where characters involved are left wondering if this had happened or not.  It is highly recommended to not begin reading resolved that the answer is simply reincarnation, and to instead explore the question in more depth.  Please be aware that, although this story is marked for profanity, its usage is both rare and constantly censored (please let me know if you see a word that should also be censored but got missed, I'm very complacient in this, as it's technically not in my nature to have used such profanity at all).",80

26804,Decompose!,"Dear diary.
When you read stories about some people missing and returning after years of absence claiming they were living in another world, your first reaction is to scoff and dismiss a story as a tall tale, right?
I know I did. All the time. Until it happened to me and I no longer did. That day was today.
Some god of thunder smote me. If it were Chris Hemsworth, I wouldn't mind but it was some barbaric Hitite god that abaondned Earth some four millennia ago.
Yes, what can I say? I love the seventh art. I have more hours watching movies than any other activity, including sleep. What? Do you think I'm exaggerating? Maybe I am. I'll really miss hollywood the most. And my biggest regret is that I never got to visit the holy city of cinema.
I did not come to another world to be a hero even though there was hints that they hoped I'd save it. I did not come with overpowered abilities able to, dunno, leap tall castles in a single bound, faster than a speeding crossbow bolt, be more powerful than a eight-horse carriage, the bounds.
No. After the asshole god that murdered me brought me to his world, he gave me some boons from his discount bin and ""The Power of my Soul (tm)"".  Forgive my french, I hope you understand I am rather upset at dying. And he somehow decided that my power is to recycle stuff. How awesome is that? Not much at first, I must admit.
At least I got all my camping stuff and equipment with me. There's no lycra in the other world. I'll make it someday, but that day is not today.
So here I am. In another world, in the middle of nowhere. I'm no heroine. As the song goes, I'm your basic average girl. And I'm assumed to be here to save the world. But almost everything can stop me, because I'm not named Kim.
 
Wish me luck, diary.

This novel is going have the following features:
slow-paced slice-of-life No GameLit / LitRPG elements. Movie references. Sandra likes the seventh art. Journal / diary style crafting (includes chemistry, engineering and metallurgy) low magic technological advancement (for Sandra, at least. She is not against sharing though) personal relations clash of perception between the modern and ancient customs. bits of tension, fighting, and plot here and there.
I won't repeat myself though. Once she crafts a good batch of soap, for example, she'll just note, ""I crafted soap again."" Once it is estabilished how she obtains compound X, compound X2 that is obtainable from the same process will also just be mentioned. I'll try to be as realistic as I can with the crafting, chemistry, and technology.

<.................>
In the world of Raekoft, magic is everywhere and flows through everyone and everything, seemingly with a mind of its own. This magic comes in all forms and understandings with the world revolving around its use.
Ritz Dravus is a 16-year-old teen with a rare potential in battle magic. After years of working and saving up money, he can finally attend the school of his dreams, Liken Academy.
If only he could enjoy his time there.
Liken Academy is a place filled with the high class. A place where power rules supreme (and is more popular). Ritz’s humble beginnings will struggle in a place where social standing and power defines a person (including their popularity).
Rittz will have to go through the usual school drama of making friends, keeping up with classes, dealing with crushes, fighting against bullies, growing insanity, magic manipulation, power scaling and the ever-looming threat of a neighbouring kingdom hungry for war.
If magic is the first rule in this world, then mayhem would be the second.

Additional summary: 

Spoiler: Spoiler


Humanity has finally made the second step towards space.  Many developments were taking place at the time this happened. All of them accomplished thanks to nanotechnology. Inventions regarding Artificial Intelligence and nanorobotics created the opportunity, a way to terraform planets by sending nanorobots to space. Their orders? Colonizing and preparing the new worlds before humanity's arrival, aka terraforming.  Meet G00, a weird agglomeration of nanomachines. A bit stupid, but it's not because he was like that. The little guy... 'He' is really broken. The hardest start of a story is when language is oddly misunderstood, when you know nothing of the place you just arrived; when your companion is a buggy system, and when you have to repair yourself with whatever trash you can scavenge from your surroundings. All of this while you fight your worst enemy: potatoes? What will you do in an unfamiliar circumstance where nothing is what it seems and where you won't even understand the boring ramblings of a confused main character? Well, patience will... probably have a reward?

Read before starting the story:


Harem: Not included for the moment, depends on characters added, votes by readers, and things that happen on the go.  
Magic: Far away chapters maybe... as part of high level or non-understandable things by science. 
Slice of life: Probably some parts will include it. 
 
Disclaimer #1: Crazy amount of content about high-tech info-dumps, slow pace, starts with biology and nanotechnology. Might have some weird jokes and puns. Game bugs are also possible. 
Disclaimer #2: No puddles were harmed during the making of this story. No character is real, no real puddle was used as part of the cast.  Character is stupid at the start on purpose but he will get beta and beta. All written content follows a logical approach no matter how stupid it appears to be, maybe… Because it’s just a raccoon splashing some cotton-candy over a puddle after it was thrown. Yup, a bully raccoon with rabies or so it seems.",190

Hi All!
This is my story, it has been brewing in my mind in various forms for years. It will be rough, this is the first story I have written in a long time, so please help me make it as great as it can be!
It is a High Fantasy adventure/Isekai LitRpg, it will have action and adventure, levels and dungeons, Elves, Dwarves and Gods.
It is not a Virtual Reality story, though it will touch on some topics of artificial intelligence.
The core focus of the story is going to be the discovery and deep delve in the magic system and fantastical elements of the world. Mana is used so often in LitRPG's but how often is it explained what mana is, magic is used in fantasy, but how often do you understand what it feels like. Magical races like Elves, Dwarves etc. often exist in stories, but why do they exist? and what truly makes them different from Humans and from each other? What is a God and where did they come from?
These are the sort of topics that I want to really dive into in this series, all through the lens of a progression focused LitRPG.
Thanks for reading!","1,277"

26915,Death By Protagonist,"As a cynic and an agent, Donovan knows not every book is worth publishing. Erwin's is one such story. Filled to the brim with tropes, wish-fulfilment, anime logic, and impractically dressed nuns. This fantasy epic would never see a printing press.
Unless it was written on a magical typewriter that made the world real.
...And Donovan happens to piss off the author enough to get trapped inside.
But as he gets entangled in this world— trashy it may be. He comes to care about its inhabitants and rekindles his love of fantasy.
Only one problem. He is this worlds all-mighty big bad. If he ever wants to get out, He'll have to wage war on the very world he's trapped in. Oh, and also make it a point to die trying.

                                                                          ...
Authors Note/Content Warning: while Death By Protagonist pokes fun at the tropes and conventions of the Isekai genre. It also wholeheartedly embraces them. Expect to read about an OP MC, kingdom building, progression elements, a harem that includes explicit ""spice"" scenes, and some ""Breasted Boobily"" character descriptions. 
My goal with this story is not to crap on these tropes, but revamp them in a way that is hopefully more mature, thoughtful and nuanced then I've seen them before. The MC is a grown man with both a sense of morality and practicality. The harem consists of adult women who still have their own shit going on outside of being love interests. And while the MC is indeed overpowered, he still goes through plenty of growth and has struggles that can't be solved by blowing them up. 
If that's not your cup of tea, no sweat, this story probably won't be enjoyable for you. If it is, I'd love your feedback on how I can build the more mature yet still fun and trashy fantasy story that I've always wanted to read.

This sealed away the exotic energy and put a stop to Abrahaem—an 'immaculatus' of unparalleled ability. In doing so, the Sentinels condemned every immaculatus to certain death as their bodies deteriorated rapidly in the absence of the exotic energy that had sustained them for hundreds of years. The world moved on in the absence of the immaculata, and many countries around the world took the opportunity to restore democracy and the rule of law following the golden age of superhumans, tearing down the old world to make way for the new. Even the word—immaculatus—was rendered taboo, a term that was a reminder of the horrors visited on humans at the hands of those who are now known as “deviates”.
But now the Fracture is reopening—whatever the Sentinels did is coming undone. Many have been preparing for this day, and those with the ability to absorb and manipulate the Fracture's exotic energy will either be sought for desperately, or hunted down in fear.

26928,May Aien Have Mercy,"He was a slave for life, born without a name. One of many, and yet few, that allowed the majority to live comfortably at the cost of their well being. Despite these circumstances, his kindness and righteousness knew no bounds. Not once had he resented the Gods or blamed destiny for his circumstances. Not once had he lost sight of what he believed in, no matter the cost he had to pay to do so.
This was the man known by his peers as Mentor.
Yet, even the ideals of such a man had one day begun to crumble under a cruel reality.
An escape attempt ended in failure, resulting in a vicious punishment that led to the man's demise. He was finally able to welcome the sweet embrace of death, but fate was not done with him yet. Reincarnated into a different world, he was filled with hope for the future. Assuming it was his just reward and a chance for a new life, he set forth into the world, trying to reach towards a simple happiness, that could make him forget his past suffering.
Alas, he didn't know how whimsical fate could be.
As betrayal followed him with every step, he realized, time and time again, the shackles of his own destiny.
Until at last, as he was faced with the injustices of his two lives, his ideals and hopes were broken beyond repair. Unwilling to restrain the accumulated hatred within him any longer, he'd finally unleashed it upon the world, where none would be spared from his hate-fueled vengeance against the world.
Thus, if you dare follow Aien on his road of destruction, leave behind your morals, and witness the birth of a Demon.",408

He had lived a good life. A man who traveled the world, saw the cultures, learned the languages. For a period, he had even discovered a historical preservation of a martial art practiced by the Samuri and Ninja in Japan that caught his interest. He learned it until he had attained a level of mastery worthy to instruct those back in his home in the United States.
Before he settled down to become a teacher, he first became a nurse. It was too late to go through the intense schooling to become a doctor, but he had been inspired by the Indian and Chinese traditions of the strong link between the ways of healing and the ways of body mastery that are the core of the martial arts.
He settled down and had his family, opened his school, and taught several students. It was a good life, his 60 years. But then, when he had finished the children’s class one day in which his own grandaughter was a student, he decided to take her for icecream. That was when it all went wrong.
He was fine after the accident. His grandaughter… was not. In that moment, someone claiming to be a fallen goddess promised him the ability to take the consequences of his mistake entirely onto himself. He would die, his grandaughter would live on in perfect health. In this moment of weakness, he could not possibly refuse.
The last thing he knew in his life was that his precious granddaughter had been saved. The first thing he knew in his next life was that he was in the womb, and he was a twin. A twin he would later discover was the very goddess who helped him to save his granddaughter.",335

A Note From the Author:
This story was written as a National Novel Writing Month 2018 entrant. As such, its entire 50,000+ word length was written between November 1, 2018 and November 31, 2018. Overall, I would consider this no more than a polished draft. In that vein, the chapters have no names, only numbers.
Special thanks to Chronus on youtube for answering my questions on NATO radio procedures!
My Apologies to the Finnish Language, which I have abused in (probably) unforgivable ways to create Twisted Empire names. If anyone is interested, break the names up by commas and toss them into your favorite translation program (I used Google Translate, and tried to avoid umlauts and other accents) for some semi bilingual boni. If I got something wrong (and I know I did… somewhere…) let me know over on reddit and I will see what I can do to fix the mistake.

I still live on my parent’s platform, which sucks because the whole island sails to Paradisia on Monday, and Paradisia sucks.
I’d much rather stay here with my friends. But I can’t afford to, because they are way more successful than me.
I did just meet this amazing girl who also lives on Gulf Sails, so at least I’ll have her to keep me company in Paradisia.

26998,Take Two!,"College student majoring in botany has a fateful encounter with truck-kun while trying to get back in shape after realizing that his freshman 15 turned into the sophomore 20, and then the junior 30.
After going through a very amusing(to some) hell, he gets the chance to transmigrate into a body of his own design on a magical world. Playing to his strengths, he chose the Plantkin race, and the new name of Sorrel to match.
This is a slow-paced, magical, slice-of-life story with a focus on relationships. There will be sex(I'll try to keep the explicit stuff to a minimum, but it will be there), swearing, really bad jokes, and enough food to spoil your diet. There will not be a lot of action, epic quests to save the world, or anything even remotely resembling a big-bad-evil-guy(a few smaller bad guys, sure. But, no BBEG).
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Note: This is a re-write of my first story ""Congratulations, You're Dead!"". And, is much more what I wish I had written in the first place. The characters and the world are very similar, with a few key differences. The story may borrow some elements from Congrats, but should be considered as its own work. Reading Congrats first is not needed, or even reccommended, not unless you want to see some really cringey romance in the early chapters.",757

Everything has changed and nothing at all. He's older, stronger, wiser... which doesn't seem to help him as much in his second year of school as he'd hoped.",2
27002,Skyhome,"Simon wakes up in his own home, with his own couch and kitchen, his own yard and his own view of a clear blue sky where a city used to be. His house seems to be floating in the sky, but at least the water is still running. Perhaps the weird glowing ring in the living room can tell him what happened?
This is a story that draws from varying elements I have encountered in fantasy novels, most notably the works of Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson (Wheel of Time, read it if you haven't yet).

Have you ever thought to yourself, “tfw no qt3.14 dragon girl gf to play vidya with?” Are you one of those lonely people who claim to prefer single-player games because you have nobody to play multiplayer games with? Do you wish that you could have a harem of cute, 10/10 waifus who just want to play video games, be lazy with you, and do cute romantic things?
Then congratulations! You don’t get any of those things, but Drake does. You do, however, get the opportunity to live vicariously through Drake as he goes to a lazy dragon’s (read: best girl’s) pocket universe that has been designed to be the perfect survival / tower defense / crafting hybrid game-turned-reality! Have I mentioned that there are cute dogs and bees involved? What about the bodybuilder cat enemies? Or the fact that I, the best informational status window and synopsis writer ever, Window, am in the story?
Oh, and you might want to keep in mind that the dragon in charge of the universe dislikes all things rational, logical, and other boring things like those.

Detective Khayne finds himself being the chief investigator on the case when a Temryl gas tycoon is found brutally murdered in his own apartment, not long before Khayne himself recieved a strange and forceful visitor in the night, warning him not to dig too deep into what is about to happen lest he find some things he doesn't like.

Even if you didn't know how you'd get home? 
Well fortunately or unfortunately, Casey Bennett got that chance when he fell into the world of ""The Queen's Riders"". His entrance into his beloved book may not have been done willingly nor was it very smooth, but he is there nonetheless. His only clue to getting home lies at the end of the story. However, there's a catch, the story he knows so well and the story unfolding in front of him are slightly different. Given a power that had been hidden away for 500 years, Casey must find a way to limit these differences in order to bring about the ending written in his book. A task made even more difficult by the fact that his own presence is already bringing about changes.

27230,Wasn't my new life in a magical world supposed to be easy?,"Victor Norman died. And then he was reincarnated into another world by a powerful entity and given awesome skills. So far so good.

He thought that his new life in a magical world would be easy. So why is it that things are turning out this way?
 
 
 
 
Hello, author here~. If you are willing to read this story, I'll warn that I am writing this story purely on a whim, with very little planning and purely for my enjoyment. I don't know how things will turn out but let's hope they will go well~. I will be giving my other story that will be rewritten and renamed later priority so there won't be consistent releases but I'll do my best not to drop it or put it on hiatus for too long.
Beware that this story will (maybe) contain: gore (moderate amounts), profanity (moderate amounts), litRPG elements, (probably) logical plot holes.
It won't contain (a lot of): politics, romance (mm, likely not much), harem.
As for the warnings about gore, profanity, sexual content and traumatising content, I don't know what I will put in there so it's not necessarily true that they will be present.

While taking a much-needed moment’s respite, Cooper is greeted by an enigmatic party who offers him a one-time deal: Carry their loot and earn some coin. Of course, nothing is ever as simple it seems; and if he knew the troubles that lay ahead, he would have asked for payment upfront.

A Japanese-American by the name of Atreus Watanabe -- member and second-in-command of the Sanada-gumi's Asano family -- awakes one morning and is ordered to meet with the influential gang's senior advisor to the chairman. To his surprise, he is tasked with solving the murder of an employee of the nation's leader in cybernetic technology and the Sanada-gumi's number one source of income, Atmos Dynamics, because the event unfortunately took place within Sanada-gumi territory, and no one knows why. He must discover the culprit as soon as possible, before the clan's already unstable relationship with the corporation is thrown into the fire and causes them unprecedented financial devastation.

Prologue
In the pitch black darkness, a young lady jolted awake from her terrifying alternate reality. 
White flashes, Fiery Lightning Rains and symbols of the Three Heavenly Tribes at war with the Netherworld’s Xiu Luo Tribe. The Nine Heavenly Cities were in chaos - and Zi Xuan City was hit the worse. A sense of panic growingly overwhelms her. Lord Father, where are you? Suddenly, a bolt of lightning cracks open across the ominous coloured skies with a deafening roar. Jin Feng! I must get to him before it’s too late! 
A shot of crimson red lace flashes before her eyes and releases her from that nightmare. In a split moment, that vision of chaos and destruction all faded to oblivion. All of it seemed so real.. she thought. Even the cuts and bruises she thought she saw on her hands felt real when she woke. This frightening battle inside her mind has been repeating itself more frequently in the past few weeks. Was this a sign? 
It has been months, even years since Yin Qian has relived this nightmare of hers. Obviously shaken by her unwelcomed dreams, she instinctively reached out to clasp that warm yellow light hanging by her chest. 
Ever since she could remember as a little girl, she was always wearing this golden metallic necklace that held a small vial pendant. Inside the vial lies a warm yellow glow, almost as if it was pure light. Whenever she felt afraid, she would hold it close in her palms and it gave her a sense of unexplainable comfort. 
Yin Qian has always tried to recall about her childhood, about her past, but could never conjure up any recollections. She has no memories, no history to speak of. For as long as she could remember, she always lived alone on this Yu Lan Mountain. She has never ventured off this mountain as well, something deep in her gut just warned her off the unknown path. All she could remember was her name - Yin Qian, and that the vial on her necklace was some kind of important artefact, something she should keep safe and never lose. 
Feeling more suffocated as she sat by the edge of her cold bamboo bed, she stood up and gently push pass the thinly constructed window panes that barely kept the harsh elements out. A gentle breeze caressed her face as she stood against the moonlight, looking out into the black wilderness that covered as far as one’s eyes could see. 
Taking a deep breath, Yin Qian began to recollect her thoughts. To be honest, this was the first time she managed to recall her dream so clearly after she regained consciousness.",1

It is the 19th century, and war smoulders between England and France.
Any hope for a quick end to Napoleon's rampage across Europe ended when the Great Gates opened in 1800. For a fortunate few, the strange world of the Infinite Labyrinth offers opportunities, strange descriptors popping in their minds, informing them of growth, and status beyond that of a mere mortal. The materials and power crystal they bring back foster a new age, both military and civilian. Aether-powered Skyships prowl the skies, as all the great nations blessed by the Gates try to turn the blessings of the Labyrinth into immediate advantages.
But for Jonas, an apprentice leatherworker, his friend Ira, and so many Londoners, the fabled ones that walk the Labyrinth are distant heroes, seen from afar. They fell short when their Potential was measured, and they fill their mundane lives with distant dreams.
One man wants to break the stalemate. The Tyrant of the Dominion of France, Napoleon Bonaparte, has a plan. Eighteen years after the world changed, he will force it to change again. And when civilians are caught in the fallout, the unthinkable happens.
Six people, unqualified, forbidden to ever enter the Labyrinth, find themselves stranded in a distant zone, forcefully turned into Professionals. They know little of what that means, but they have to figure out the rules that are now their lot, for they have little hope to escape their predicament otherwise. They need to understand what the descriptors in their minds mean, what each of the strange piece of gear waiting in treasure chests behind terrible guardians can bring them. They have to become Professionals on their own and rejoin the Empire. They will figure out their new lives one way or another.
But will there be an Empire waiting for them when the Gates re-open? Caught in a clash of empires and high tiers, they will do what little they can. They will step up and do their best.
One way or another.

 

 
The Infinite Labyrinth is a slice-of-life litRPG adventure set in a real historical setting. It's a hard, crunchy litrpg. Expect blue boxes everywhere, and the system itself is very mathy.
It started life as a serial. I prepared some proper worldbuilding, with enough details and background for lots of different potential story arcs, but as I wrote, I realized the main story needs to have a definitive end. So, there are four books in total, for a bit under 1500 pages, plus additional side stories, and even maybe a sequel one day.

27265,"Warhammer 40,000: Mind over Matter","Set in the Warhammer 40k universe, but accessible to those unfamiliar with the setting.

The Imperium of Man has been fighting the Long War for ten thousand years. It is a war fought simultaneously across thousands of stars and against innumerable enemies. On smoke-filled battlefields and in the cold emptiness of the void the military might of the Imperium stands strong in the face of horrifying foes. It is not a war fought to conquer new lands, or to seize the wealth of enemy nations. It is a war fought to hold what they have, or to regain what they have already lost.
The world of Nova Iberia is far from that war and supports the Imperium by sending her finest sons to foreign stars to fight and die as elite commandos in the Imperial Guard. A chance discovery on the corpse of one of these commandos has cast doubts around the world's loyalty, and has drawn the attention of the Imperial Inquisition. The seekers of the Alien, the Heretic and the Daemon have descended upon this peaceful world, and they will not leave it intact.
Primaris Psyker Amelia Lafayette was a ward of the state, now bound as an acolyte to the Inquisition in recognition of her telepathic gifts. Inexperienced, and browbeaten by her training, she must adapt to her new circumstances or fall. If she can navigate the tangled webs of heresy, and survive life in the Inquisition, then she may find the opportunity to prove herself worthy of greater authority.",155

Regardless of which is true, it's certainly true that this land is not one that can be tamed so readily. I have been to the northern wall, I have seen with my own eyes the twisted horrors that lie beyond, and I can understand the stories and records of demons laying low entire cities in a single night.
Nevertheless, this is our home. With the blessing of the Gods we have pushed back the horrors of the north farther than any who have come before us. Let us be the beacon that lights the way for all of Humanity, and define our future as one of glory and triumph.
The kingdoms of men are tired of falling, this day we stand and fight.
- Words spoken by Jakath Oneskii, High Archpriest of Duriem.

So hey there, welcome to my story that I'm writing. A few things you should know before you carelessly dive into it:
This is going to be the greatest story you've ever read. Not much I can do about that, sorry.
I mean really, think about it, it's inevitable.
my grammar is on point
Speling iz gr8.
""Punctuation. in. all. the. right. places,
And to top it all off, a worldbuilding folder and story plan so elegantly perfect that it can be compressed into one of the smallest information storage systems on the planet: My brain!
So buckle your seatbelt buckaroo because what you're about to experience is going to be unlike anything you've ever imagined and I'm not at all even worried about living up to the expectations I'm setting because I dedicate so much of my life to writing that even if you're reading this as I'm writing it the first chapter is probably halfway done and I am not at all making that up.

While I was leisurely bathing under the sunlight or lying in the depths of the sea, I came across some interesting creatures. Whether it was mermaids, fairies or even normal human beings, I always spectated on them from afar.
What seemed more intriguing for me was watching how they interacted with each other, how they fought and laughed together. I don't know when it happened, but I soon started wondering what it would be like to experience those feelings and to become one of them.

27325,Infinite Realm: Monsters & Legends,"The world has ended, and those worthy of it have received the chance for a new life in a new reality.
Zach grew in power and thrived in the post-Framework world. He became a respected leader, a shining example of what it meant to be good. But as the world ended, he had only one thought: to punish the monster that had killed the world long before the Framework ended it. Yet not even with his incredible power was he able to stand against the World Ender. His arrival in the new realty, the Infinite Realm, gives him the chance to grow stronger, to find the monster again—and make it pay.
Ryun survived the chaos after the arrival of the Framework by pushing harder than anyone else. He grew in power until he became the most powerful being that had ever walked the planet; but he is hated by the world, called a monster by all others, the World Ender. As the world ends and he steps into a new one, where people stronger than him have lived for centuries, he finds himself lost and without purpose. The only thing that had mattered to him had been lost to him long ago. He truly was the monster that people considered him to be, and he now finds himself wondering if this new reality has a place for someone like him—but he had never been one for lying down and dying without a fight. One world fell to his power, and another might follow.

27347,Techno-Heretic,"Eli is an ancient man sentenced to death for the crime of surpassing the sacred number of 32.8, which is the allowed percentage of increased mental ability from the use of AI chips. As he journeys through death and into a world of fantasy and magic, he finds himself approaching never before seen heights of magical power and ability. Powers that will shape the world and would see him go down in legends for generations ever after.
But just because someone acquires magical abilities, that doesn't mean magic is suddenly the most important thing in their life. 
Some people aren't looking to be all-powerful gods, have the world bow at their feet, or spend their days obsessing over accumulating ever more power. Some people just want acceptance, stability, and the warmth of their loved ones to drive away the cold loneliness of the night. And in a world where magic is the bedrock of society, where magic is what determines who is preferred for siring children, where people with high magical ability are destined to live in great luxury and those without magic simply live to make due, this difference in values and perspective could not have a starker contrast. 
As Eli and the people around him navigate the misconceptions and deceptions of this world, he will represent a great and magnificent future for the human race. One where humanity will stand above the elves, dwarves, orcs, fairies, and all the horrors of the world. Sadly, men's tools are as fallible as the people who make them, and in a society where the potential of an individual is determined solely through their magical level, this seed of promise may yet turn venomous.

27359,Recruit - An Infinite Labyrinth prequel,"A prequel to The Infinite Labyrinth.
The year is 1816. The British Empire is in full swing, under the auspices of King George III. The Infinite Labyrinth has been pouring out its product from beyond our reality and fostered a new industrial revolution. Times are changing, and the people of London are feeling the winds of the revolution while British Professionals push into the Labyrinth.
The newly formed Artefact Hunting Company is looking for recruits, and they have new technology to help them. From the slums of London, they aim to recruit a new wave of Professionals. And make Zacharias and the Earl of Carnavon lots of money.
So, for Rowan Rivers and a handful of lucky ones, it's time to head into the Labyrinth, and discover what makes it different from England. And what makes THEM different?

Recruit is a bunch of chapters I wrote to create to the setting, mood, and game systems of the Infinite Labyrinth. It is NOT a complete story in the classic sense. It's more of a slice of life view of early days of a normal Professional from the Infinite Labyrinth, and it's heavy on info-dump. It's 90% canon - there's probably a bit of a difference between how some characters and common behaviour are portrayed here and how they'll come out in the main story.
Set two years before the events that kick-start the main series, it features some of the secondary/peripheral characters of the Infinite Labyrinth and will tell you all about the basic mechanics of the Labyrinth's RPG system. It can be considered a spoiler, as the characters in the Infinite Labyrinth are going to need to figure out all that, on their own. But if you like a much deeper exposition in the mechanics, here it is.

The Medical Technologies Company. It seemed to suddenly appear out of nowhere in the middle of what's now called City Center. Once just a manufacturer and developer of medical equipment, it eventually started to dabble in medical research. Before anyone even knew it, they were the leading research entities, with five seperate buildings in Valley City alone, all towering above everything else in the area. Some say they even swayed the local government into combining the old towns into one city and popularized prosthetic limbs as fashion themselves, but that's just gossip.
Matthew Vega. A 25-year-old college dropout, tricked by MediTech into being experimented on under the pretense of participating in a clinical trial for rent money. After being broken out of their facility nearly a year after having her limbs replaced, then having her liberator captured, she seeks a way to dismantle the company or save the one she cares about.

After all the chapters are rewritten, they will either replace the current chapters or be posted as a separate book on this site. This book has been a passion project for years now, and I've taken a long time away from it and wanted to revisit it with the same passion and respect that I first had when writing it. I am horrible with guessing how long things take and don't want to put a deadline on it, but I am hoping to have the entire book rewritten by the end of 2024. If you want a taste of what's to come, feel free to continue onwards, just know that the revised version will deviate a fair amount from the current version. 
- The Demonic Eye <3

Monsters, gold, chaos, glory, adventure, what more could attract two of the greatest players of all time to Sugarea, the most popular MMORPG of its time. But everyone makes errors, and unfortunate for these two brilliant players, they have made the grave mistake of not actually sleeping like normal humans and missed out on the very moment the new Dark Legion update would take effect. Or did they? They wake in what seems familiar yet not, but they soon realize their predicament. They are inside their game avatar's bodies! A half-Demon and a Dragonoid are now struggling with more than just power, these two men have to find their new purpose and calling in a completely different world. Will they concur it like ordinary land or will they enlighten the planet into equality? Do figures pull strings in the dark or is everything open to the public eye? Nothing is certain except the unknown, and nothing is ever as it seems...
This is an Isekai story, as such, some parts may sound either cliché or similar to others, but I assure you, I tried to prevent that. To make it known, I took quite a lot of inspiration from the light novel/anime Overlord, but that doesn't mean it's a direct rip-off of it. You'll find there to be quite the amount of differences. Just a little heads up as well, you should expect irregular uploads, as it takes me a long time to write each chapter. I am currently trying for once every other week on Sundays around 10:00 A.M. Chapters are usually 7k words and up, with the longest (chapter 3) being 10.3k words. So, if you like to sit down and read a long chapter every two weeks at 10:00 A.M. EST on Sundays, then you can waste your time here!
Small disclaimer: Profanity is far and few between, and mostly used by side characters, rarely the main character. When something with gore happens, I describe to the best of my ability, which will only get better the longer I write this... :) Small cuts between perspectives happen, and can hide what some characters do, which will be revealed in future chapters, I'm not that lazy... all the time... There are some parts that are long blocks of text, most, if not all, of them, are characters talking, but I try not to info dump. I know one of the tags says ""Psychological"", and for the most part, it is, but it's not as prominent as other stories, instead, it's more hidden and scattered, but I did try to make the pieces I did reveal all fit together.
Cover art is bound to be changed when I have a good picture to use, so the Yin-Yang is a placeholder for now unless yall wanna gimme something to use *wink wink nudge nudge*. So yeah, please give it a try, as I have nothing better to do with my life, and I am banking solely off of a career in literature and am hoping that I can create a story that can actually be called something more than a child's imagination running wild. The eventual and inevitable end to the story won't be for a long while, at least till chapter 40 or so. I have thought long and hard about the message and themes at play, so I hope you, the reader (who has some amazing hair btw), can enjoy and partake on this adventure with me into my dark empty pit of imagination.",34

--AUTHOR NOTE, PLEASE READ--
I will state here my promises to you, potential reader:
1. No harem! I don't trust myself to make a harem feel natural or healthy, I never met any person who has a personality that can adapt and live in a harem for reasons that are not monetary, so I can't draw inspiration from real life. Sorry!;
2. The enemies will not be bland and illogically mean. Some may feel like that at first, but I will take great care in fleshing them out, trust me. You may end up hating some, but you won't be able to deny that they had their reasons for what they did;
3. I am using a paid (and expensive) automated editor tool, and I take longer to write because I take my time in editing the stuff. I am aiming to improve and I will not shy away from constructive criticism, nor take offense for no reason;
4. Characters will die and will suffer, some will get over the tragedies and improve, others will not be as resilient.
5. This novel has a lot of ground to cover, it is neither a short story, a manual on crafting, or the script of some action scene. There will be both time skips and oversimplifications of some actions for the sake of moving the story forward. Time skips will be more prominent in the first 30 chapters. I will describe crafting processes and fights with more detail if they are essential for the chapter;
6. If I took my time describing something, it's because it is important. I hate novels that waste time describing useless stuff. If you skim over something, the chances are that something in the future will not make sense. I am an adept of ""Chekhov's gun"" principle;
7. I already have 31k words on my auxiliary documents, I have a plan for the story, and I will not be making changes even if someone ends up noticing some foreshadowing and figures out what will happen. The story comes first.
8. I have a wife, a job that demands 9h every day and courses related to my job (lawyer) three days of the week, it's unlikely that I will be able to do mass releases at all. I will have a healthy amount of chapters to be able to post at least 1 chapter every day continually. Don't worry.
9. I will read all the comments. I will listen to all you have to say and will try my best to accommodate demands as long as they do not hamper the path I prepared.
10. There is an arc that spans the entire novel. Each volume will be an arc in itself while progressing a little bit of the main arc. Every arc will have one or more main antagonists.
I think that's it! Thank you for reading it all. Have an awesome time reading my first novel!! <3","2,061"

That a hero does not come with fanfares and the cheering

What he doesn't know is that things are far from that simple.Note from the Author: THIS IS NOT A DEATH GAME STORY Hi there, this will be a side project for me to explore some other interests that do not fit my main story. This story will be a side project and will not take away time from either work or the other story I am writing. It is really meant for me to just relax and enjoy the process (whereas the other one is more for me to force myself into participating in the process to improve). This story will include Kingdom Building, Weak to Strong, Some Historical Elements, Strategy, Magic, Blue Boxes and more. The MC will be involved in some casual relationships and eventually a serious one. That said, this will not be a harem story; if a girl ends up with another dude, that will not be cuckolding or any of that kind of thing, it will be, you know, girls choosing to be with other dudes.

Disclaimer: 
Though the book has Xianxia tag there will be no chinese names in the novel because it would be quite idiotic of me to try and use chinese names without understanding what they mean or represent and for that you have my apologies.
What this tag represents is that you'll have a working cultivation system, fighting techniques, people on the quest to reach the top of the world, a world built around cultivation. Of course, everything with my own salt and pepper added to it. Hope you won't be veered off right here and will try a different take on the xianxia genre. I can assure you you won't be disappointed.

Release Schedule - Ideally, Weekly Updates on Fridays or Saturdays. 
Chapter Size - Around 2200 Words
Book Size - Honestly, I Don't Know.

This is my first story!
Note: The prologue differs wildly in tone from the rest of the story.
I'm playing it safe on the tags. I don't think the story really deserves the profanity or gore content warnings, but the main character does swear and get hurt. That said, the main character is a succubus. Sexual content is a given.",45

27562,Splice,"I forgot everything as soon as I passed into my new world. And that was what this was, my new reality. Any personal history I had with me had simply been erased. Parents, siblings, friends. Wiped from my mind. Perhaps the one solace being that I knew the caveats of this new world and thus it was likely I had no one.
They were selective of what memories we were allowed to keep. For one, I remember signing the papers. The rustles of the large stacks of sheaves. I knew what a contract was. I knew a handful of things, but as my mind alighted upon them, they were whisked away. The details were far away, like the faint memory of birth, if I had it. I was doubtful they would be having any bearing of me thus forth.
Personality. That was one thing they allowed, else what were we but empty shells, blank slates once we entered? Tabula Rasa. I raised my mental attention at the term, or rather the clear theory in my mind? That was funny, in a way, even though despite not even knowing my name but nonetheless feeling firm in my own mental state I very well might be shaped into something new.",6
27563,Trigna The Aberrant Adventurer,"“Life is not fair” is one thing unanimously agreed upon. The world was separated into two types of beings. NPCs, those were just like those normal people found in our world… And PCs, those with extraordinary power and magic, able to grow stronger through fighting and killing others. PCs were unanimously superior to their NPC counterparts by leaps and bounds… Our story focused on a PC named Trigna Silver. Trigna, being an unusual demi-human with immense strength and a talent for fighting, is considered an abomination by most, and is hated as a result by many before they can get to know him. Will he become someone more in line with a traditional hero, descend into villainy, or something else altogether?
This is not a story of an everyman farm boy who goes off to save the world and inspire others. This is not the story of a hero who goes out of his way to save every person they meet out of the goodness of his heart for nothing in return. This is not a story where the protagonist is a goody two shoes who can do no wrong. This is not a story about bigger numbers taking the place of the plot. This is not a story where all “not heroes” are heroes in everything but name. This is not a story where all “good guys” are all they’re cracked up to be. This is not a story where “bad guys” are just evil enough to be redeemed because they do the bare minimum to be considered evil. Despite all this is not a story that’s all gloom and doom either, that would be boring… If anything, there’s optimism and comedy inside in addition to everything else. This is a story about an adventurer, and what type of person would go leave their homes to go kill things for fun and profit. The morality of that, I’ll leave up to you. After all, if a monster can kill a hundred men, what does that make the man that can kill a monster?

He is a Ludum Haeres. The last remnant of a Summoner. Numbered among those few capable of changing their destinies. The unseen rulers of the world known as Vesperia, and one of the most powerful creatures in existence.
The woman knows none of this. And so, she picks up the card...
 
This is my third novel on Royal Road, the first being ""Beyond the Horizon's Eye"", and the second being ""The Dawnfire Archives"". This story is something of a test in a new genre, that of CardLIT. We'll see how well it succeeds as the story continues. It takes place in a different setting than my other tales, with an entirely new cast of characters. It does, however, contain several ties between the stories.

And every year, the four main Houses of Endymion gather their men and resources to form the Annual army to fight back the Horde. That's been the way of things for nearly 100 years. But where once the Horde was simply a collection of mindless monsters, there are some who have attained the knowledge to effectively fight humanity.  And where once specially attuned humans, called Poteres, could connect to the Lunar and Solar planes and have unimaginable abilities, they are no longer able to tap into that vast power.

I will attempt to update weekly, but I make no promises.
I am an amature writer, and there will be rambling in this story.
I have written short stories before, but I haven't written anything in 6 years. This story will have loose grammatical standards, as anything too stressing might be enough for me to relapse into depression. I will except criticism, but please refrain from simply saying it's bad. I learned a lot about writing when I published my first story on the internet 6 and something years ago because the community gave me constructive criticism.
Inform me of any grammatical errors that bother you, and I will attempt to fix them.
Please be gentle, and hopefully enjoy. :)",44

Keep in mind this is a work of fiction and I'm not real, so any events that take place in the aforementioned fiction are just that, fiction. This isn't original however and takes place in the borderlands universe, it was going to be original but putting it in a borderlands setting gives people who are familiar an idea of what this may be like, so warning you now it'll get dark, there will be light moments as well, because I'm not some edgy angst filled teenager but just know that this ain't for the lighthearted or weak stomached.

.
.
.
If you want a less hidden-meaning summary: This story is about the struggles of one girl as she tries to become an Immortal. There won't be any meaningful romance, but there will be a plot that spans most of the story, and violence. Oh the violence! I'm not going to say that my ideas are 100% original (because hoo boy are there a lot of Wuxia), but hopefully I can write something entertaining. 
Guaranteed things: 
1. Cliche events with a twist (I mean, it's literally in the description) 
2. Important Characters will have backstories and motivations that will hopefully make them not one-dimensional (honestly, that's just normal stuff...)
3. Untrustworthy characters (everyone in the story lies, even me, so don't trust everything you read... but at the same time, trust everything you read) 
4. Goodish grammar (not gonna say mine's the best, but it's readable in most cases)
5. Plot! (Everywhere!) 
6. worldbuilding? (Should be there somewhere, but I probably won't do blatant info dumps... probably) 
7. Character development? (Its there... at some point...)
8. The story gets dark at some points (if you don't like characters dying, then this might not be your cup of tea) 
9. A strong main character? (She'll be strong, yes. However, her enemies are also strong. If everyone is strong, then is she no longer strong? My brain hurts)  
10. Wow, this list is going on for awhile... uh, Believable and reasonable Action? (I mean, I'm writing for mainly my fun, so if I want a fight scene, then I might craft a scenario to explain it... or I might suddenly throw in a Dragon and call it a day) 
This story also goes by the same name over on Webnovel.com, but I'm going to be updating it here because, well I want to. They are both by me, and created by me. If there's anything that seems like a copy of another work, then that's just the genre being saturated by everything under the sun.",14

The last thing Rommie remembered was dying in the hospital. Then she woke up on an alien spaceship with two of them staring down at her. “You’re here to be trained for your new life,” they told her. “Fighting back against hostile invaders from outside the galaxy.”
The aliens who snatched Rommie from her death bed were from an advanced planet in the Milky Way. They traveled the galaxy and recruited fighters from people near death on less advanced planets like Earth that had been invaded but didn’t know it.
Rommie completed intense training and thought she was ready for anything. But she wasn’t prepared for what she found in the place she was sent to fight outer-galaxy aliens – the office building of a large Earth tech company.
If you’ve ever suspected that your coworkers might have come from another galaxy, then this book is for you.

27679,Dispatches from the Inter-galactic,"Dispatches From The Inter-Galactic is a series of loosely related satirical stories which take place in a galaxy full of various interstellar civilizations and numerous space faring species generally described as consentients. This series is set in a galaxy which take place in a similar but not entirely unlike the galaxy in which my series Up in Space takes place
While there are numerous themes related to interstellar life, several of the stories directly relate to specific themes such as;
The pan-galactic ramifications to the use of supersymetrical energy sources (often drained from intera-located alternate and pocket realities.) the use of which by most interstellar civilizations is steadily increasing the overall amount of Dark Matter.  This is increasing the mass of the galaxy and results in the occasional rips in inter-dimensional space as well as an overall increase in supernova activity.  It is also speeding up the approach of the galaxy in Andromeda, which is of concern to several long lived civilizations;
The Morphoids, a race of shape-changing consentients who are capable of using the space lanes created by the use of supersymetrical sourced energy to spread throughout the galaxy.  They are currently viewed as threat number one by many space-faring species;
and
Xeno and exo-sexuality, as many species try to figure out what sort of enjoyment they can have with many of the species they encounter in space (only some of which are carbon-based, or more rarely, humanoid in appearance).  This also relates to the altering of species to make reproduction somewhat easier for those with rather complicated lifestyles.  A major force in this area of pursuit is the galactic visiteering industry, which promotes the ‘uplifting’ of more primitive planet-bound near-consentients.",5

An ugly frog finally finds a friend.
A self-imposed delusion unravels and quickly crumbles.

""Of Frogs, Ducks, and Other Things — A Compendium of Short Stories"" is what it advertises: a small, but slowly growing collection of short stories of my own making.
If any of the single sentence summaries above have grabbed your attention, please do give my stories a chance, and don't hesitate to give me feedback. I am far from perfect, but I do strive to improve, so it really would be much appreciated.
Before you dive in, however, I have to warn you of two things.
First and foremost: I'm not good at writing happy stories. I've tried a few times so far, and it never turned out as intended. Never turned out as a happy story. Always turned out as what I do best: stories thick with negative emotions. As such, I advise you to be prepared to leave any of my stories with a heavy knot of emotions in your chest. This also doubles as a bit of a trigger warning, since a few of my beta readers (aka friends and family that I forced into reading my stuff) asked that I please give them a headsup next time.
Secondly: I do not have a set update schedule, as I usually lack the time, motivation, or creativity to get some writing done. Therefore, I only have a very limited backlog, and once that runs dry, downtime between updates will be defined by how much I write. Which, in all honesty, could mean anything from days to months of downtime. If that is something you can't bear, I completely understand, but I'd still appreciate if you at least gave what I currently have a chance.

Synopsis

Max finds himself in a time loop. Any kind of death annuls everything except his present knowledge and returns him to the past. This is a good way to test all sorts of things. That is, it would be, if not for one little thing... This loop has real lords and it’s unlikely that they’ll be happy to hear about an uninvited guest.
And that isn’t his only problem — all of his memories of the last year have simply disappeared, but the world around him has changed in the meantime. Earth has been seized by the Velly clan and is now part of their Star Empire. Max has also discovered his gift. He’s a psychic.
However, his power isn’t that big of a deal.
Everyone can be a level one “battery.” To do anything else, however, you need to have some talent, money, and connections, which only complicates things further.
A whole new world, great opportunities, and lots of chances to get into trouble... Welcome to the Last Time Loop!",672

Earth has finally qualified...

Author's note:  Chapters will be anywhere from 6k to 10k in words, varying based on the plot beats instead of specific word counts.  
Realistic actions and teamwork will be important aspects of my story.  I'm trying something a little different in writing a realism focused litRPG, hoping to capture the essence of how real people would react to their situation.  People are complex and don't always get along.  I don't recommend starting the series expecting wish fulfillment tropes just because it's tagged litRPG.  It's a survival story with the game settings on Hell difficulty.  The plot hasn't gotten there yet, but in the future of the series I want to recreate my nostalgia of forty person raids on Ragnaros, but with the high stakes of boss battles in Sword Art Online. I also love puzzle rooms so expect one of those each book.

27801,Dragons of Dark Rebellion in A World of Essence,"In a world where cultivation is the highest form of virtue, the purity of one’s blood is of absolute value.
Saul is neither Arloni, nor Delcairan. He’s both.
But when a strange ring suddenly falls into his hands, nineteen year old Saul is more than willing to push the boundary between fantasy and reality. However, things are not as they once were in Falden.
At a time where Saul finally confronts lord Albryte’s sons after years of torment and abuse, his father’s health is fading fast. Suddenly faced with the consequences of his actions, Saul is forced to make a difficult decision. And as he fights his own battle, dark forces descend upon Lucidia.
Followed by a pair of glowing red eyes, a stranger appears in the night, visiting Falden with unfavorable intentions. Even worse, nameless assassins strike at the heart of the capital, leaving Eliza Zaryph, the black sheep of the ruling house of Lucidia, shouldering the burden of governing a kingdom that once turned its back on her.
As the world marches toward chaos, their lives take a drastic turn. Will Saul abandon those he holds most dear? Will Eliza drown herself in the past? Or will they struggle against fate and seize the future with their own hands? Tomorrow remains uncertain. But the Sun will show them the way.
 
Author's Note:
Inspired by the Wuxia/Xianxia genre the magic system is comprised of cultivating through different Worlds of power, where each World offers more strength and abilities.

27817,a cultivation realm dungeon,"couldn't come up with a better name. suggestions welcome.
i would like to mention in advance(slight spoiler) for all who suggest name, the novel actually isn't about cultivation or cultivators, the protagonist is too stingy to allow the weak ones to waste their meager energy and so it would take a while before there would even be something remotely close to it. she herself is incapable of housing powerhouses at the moment, making the number of living immortals absolutly zero for a long time, and the path of strength she makes is through her inspiration she carried in life cultivating and would hold some hints of it, that the denizens wouldn't notice. they do cultivate, but they are unaware, so i really struggle with the name currently.
---
i died. it was expected. 
who would have thought that i would have a third life? well i didn't.
so, finding myself being a being of pure energy who feeds on energy for groth, i just have to make a dungeon, no? people are the greatest container of energy after all.
i mean, i could be a predator or something, a realm eater of that sort, chaos bringer and the like, but that's boring!!
let's make a dungeon like the one's i read about two lifes ago and become an awesome realm all wish to visit and die in! and give me energy!!!

Realm 0 was the strongest realm in the universe thanks to its ruler, Xyuou Mindred.
Mindred maintained power so devasting that his very existence was unstable. From this fact alone, the wise refused to challenge him while the brave were all met with the same defeat.
Mindred sealed away the majority of his power in 7 cataclysmic 'Pneuma Orbs'. Most would fear that these orbs in the wrong hands could ruin the balance of power maintained by 'the great ones'. However, such fears didn't bother him as he knew no one could fall toe-to-toe in order to collect them.

27955,"Romeo, India’s: Where was his Juliet?","""In the ballet of rain, delicate droplets traced the silhouette of your hair, gracefully descending from your forehead to your eyes, lingering on your lips, and finally, as if enchanted, caressing the contours of your breasts. In this ephemeral dance, envy welled within me for those raindrops that intimately explored the canvas of your being.""
 ""I pledge to you, my dearest, that you shall reign as the undoubted princess of my heart until my final breath escapes. In the ever-changing tide of people flowing in and out of our lives, only a select few leave indelible footprints on the sands of our souls. Your footprints, a testament to the profound connection we share, adorn the landscape of my heart. The fragrance you've etched into the corridors of my mind is a treasure I shall forever hold dear. In this present moment, you stand not only as the pinnacle but as the very essence of my achievements in this life. My love for you transcends the boundaries of your estimation, reaching depths that words fail to articulate. Now, I beseech you, grant me the promise that the memory of our love won't fade from the tapestry of your thoughts.""
 The story unfolds against the canvas of 1999-2000, an era when Internet communications were in their embryonic overture, much like the tentative opening chords of a musical composition. It narrates the poignant tale of a long-distance romance between an impassioned Indian software engineer and an enigmatic woman discovered through the enchanting realms of Getfriends.com. What secrets lie within these digital sonnets, and where did, or will, the elusive woman vanish to? Can love endure the relentless crescendos imposed by distance and the symphonic interplay of age disparity? At the tender age of 23, the Indian protagonist composed these electronic ballads, fully cognizant of the societal norms clandestinely prohibiting the crescendo of their love.
 This narrative resonates with the timeless tragedy of Romeo and Juliet, weaving a modern sonnet that beckons the question: what will be the cadence in a world where human beings strive to redefine love and relationships in the ever-evolving symphony of the 21st century?",11

An era of magical might that would challenge the high heavens themselves and bring ruin to all that strived to be called gods. She should have been the beacon of progress.
But what no one knew, on the inside Valerie was already long broken. The medication for a mental illness that had ravaged her mind since childhood would soon rob her of her Magical Talents completely and leave her as a mere normal human. Her parents had abandoned her and most of her so-called friends were only after the fame and money.
Convinced that the entire world was working against her and everyone was trying to rob her of whatever was left, she sought out darker powers. Something that would rid her of her failing mind, something that would finally provide her with the power that she needed to escape the clutches of society. Little did she know that gifts from the beyond rarely come without strings attached.
Maybe her first clue should have been all the teeth and tentacles?

Sourced From: My First Familiar Assigned text for third-year mages
For young mages, obtaining their first familiar is a momentous occasion. Their magic forms a symbiotic relationship with their bonded mage, amplifying their's strengths and covering for their weaknesses. Often the strength of one's familiar is a key factor in how far a mage will go in their career. They are considered a necessity in the Empire of Afaron and the surrounding nations.
Once familiars were caught in the wild and brought back for training and bonding. Eventually, however, the wild magic beasts were hunted to the point that they could no longer be found. Those that had been bred domestically would often produce magicless offspring. Nowadays the mages of Afaron know nothing of how familiars are bred, raised, and tamed. Once every three years, the Order of Beast Tamers come down from their mountain strongholds with caravans loaded with familiars purchased by noble families and magic academies.
The Beast Tamer's generosity hides a dark truth. If you can't find a magic beast, make one.

Author notes: This is a story I started writing roughly two years ago (roughly 2017) on a whim and started using it to improve my writing skills.

28023,Katalepsis,"For Heather Morell, nightmares and hallucinations lurk around every corner, relics of schizophrenia and childhood bereavement.
Until she meets Raine and Evelyn, that is — self-proclaimed bodyguard and bad-tempered magician — and learns she’s not insane at all. The spirits and monsters she sees are all too real, the god-thing in her nightmares is teaching her how to surpass human limits, and her twin sister who supposedly never existed could still be alive, somewhere Outside, beyond the walls of reality.
Heather plunges into a world of eldritch magic and fanatic cultists, trying to stay alive, stay sane, and deal with her own blossoming attraction to dangerous women. But being ‘In The Know’ isn’t all terror and danger. Sometimes the monsters wear nice dresses and stick around for afternoon tea. Sometimes you find you have more in common with them than you think. Perhaps this is Heather’s chance to be something more than the defeated husk she’d grown up as, to find real friendship and meaning among things like herself - and perhaps, out there on the rim of the possible, to bring her twin sister back from the dead.
 
Katalepsis is an Ancient Greek word which means ‘comprehension’, or perhaps more accurately, ‘insight’. Katalepsis is a serial web novel about cosmic horror and human fragility, urban fantasy and lesbian romance, set in a sleepy English university town.

The sword is greater than a simple weapon; an answer to life's questions.
An extension of thine master's hand, guided by wrist.
Care it not whether guilty or innocent blood shed, for be it a mere edge, a weapon.
For blade that forgets or refuses to cut be shameful, meaningless, disgraceful. Nay, be it considered a tool at all?
What dost the weapon do when the steel hath no guide, that the master hath mingled far?
Doth it Stay? Perhaps quiver at possibility, the loss of reason for existence?
Or does it go forth into the unknown, guided by merely the wind and the edge?
A wandering sword, a phantom blade-

To any new writers out there, remember that even if the stuff you write is trash, you can still learn a lot from writing it. - November 17th 2020
Guy gets involved in advocacy for civil engineering projects, then gets pulled into an interdimensional war.
Third person with a focus on one main character (Stanley) with the occasional point of view from another character important to story progression. Writing style tends to shift early on as I figure out how to write (this is my first book). Still learning, hoping to improve.
Current style choice is to have a focus on character dialogue/actions with interspersed internal monologue in italics.
No current end is set for the story, with the primary goal of this project being to learn to express myself in a written format. Storyline is kept as consistent as practical while covering things I find interesting.
Governmental systems are mentioned, but not explained in extreme detail. Sci fi elements are used to reinforce and guide plot progression as I'm able. Personal goals belonging to each character are in the process of being developed, with the hope that they will support or oppose each other in interesting ways later on.

28123,Keys of the Endpoint,"Keys of the Endpoint is an illustrated web serial about the re-birth of civilization in a fantastical world suffering from a recent apocalyptic event.
Every day, people appear from the storms that ravage the Endpoint. Whisked away from their own time and place by storms in their homelands, these newcomers find themselves in a hostile place made up of ruins and people from every timeline imaginable. Stranger still, they all soon discover they're carrying silver keys that grant each holder incredible powers.
On Earth, most people have mundane excuses for the disappearances, but not Isaac. Having lost his brother Finn to one of these storms, Isaac becomes obsessed with finding a pattern. Not to prevent more people disappearing, but rather to get taken by the storms himself in order to find his brother. While chasing Finn’s faint trail, Isaac soon discovers how little he really knew about himself, his brother and how much loss one person can take.
In Keys of the Endpoint there's portal fantasy, personal drama, magic (useable by everyone), plenty of combat, power progression, mysteries, factions, feuds and eventually war (in that order). The magic system is well defined and modular with nigh infinite combinations. The story starts out with one of the two main characters looking for his lost brother but quickly expands in scope from that point on.

Her favorite thing in the world was playing her MMORPG, Kunoichi Online after her college classes were done. She looked forward to it each day, no matter how stressful things got, but when Ayuka fell asleep while playing the game one night, something peculiar happened. She was brought into a different dimension by a deity. This deity had noticed her game-playing abilities and thought she would be the perfect person to save his world from ruin.
His world was set in Nara, similar to feudal Japan, where he created shinobi clans, but his most prized clan comprised of only kunoichis. Many of these kunoichi fighters were wives of husbands who went off to fight in the war. The clan, although at times had in-fighting, were like a band of sisters who would lay down their lives for each other.
Ayuka reincarnated into Hikari and she must learn to gain entrance into the prized clan. Luckily, she kept most of the stats of when she played Kunoichi Online, however, her first mission is to become recruited by them. As part of the deal with the deity.
As luck would have it, Hikari stumbled upon the evil clan, The Clan of the Black Harvest, as they sacrificed a virgin in hopes to summoning their old leader, Amun-Ra. Find out if Ayuka can save the world from the unknown evil! Find out if Ayuka can learn to reject the lie she had believed all this time and embrace the truth? Find out in Kunoichi Online: Blade Wars, Book 1 in Hidden Warrior.",8

The point is that most of the time it is a huge pain in the neck. Anyways, this is my story.-Seth",17
28191,"Power, Game, System, Player","Many are those who look to the gifted, the enhanced, with jealousy and envy. The usual super strength, speed, and flight. The power to conjure phantasmal creatures. Shift into other beings, gaining their strengths. Perfect manipulation and mastery of their body. The power to influence plants, or to heal the most grievous injuries. To harness the sun, or manipulate desert sand. To flow between bodies of water, or store things in personal spaces. When all of these and more exist, who couldn't look to such an assortment and think: if only it were me?
Ludus Silva lived in the Woods, and thought, like any mundane, much about the what if's of life. Despite that, his life little depended on the enhanced and so his thoughts rested on them as he saw them; on the news and in his dreams. He enjoyed the pleasures of his semi-secluded life, so the ugly jealousy and envy towards the enhanced never had a chance to take root. Hunting, gathering, building his house, spending time with his parents, and selling his excess in the city. Those were his pleasures, though routine they may be. It was most definitely not an ordinary upbringing, but it was his and it was what he had known. 
Of course, if a kid cared not of the enhanced, then it was good odds they cared about video games. What else to do in the middle of the Woods when the day's tasks were done?
And so we come to the inevitable question of what makes Ludus Silva so special?
Well, that'd have to be his power, of course.",82

28199,The Loyal Ones [Dark Biopunk Fantasy],"TLDR; A slave monster survives horror, war and servitude, while trying to live with himself. 

Thralls are a race of monstrous slave soldiers, in a universe where biological magic takes the place of technology. Centuries ago, their ancestors were desperate humans, who volunteered to be transformed  for the Poison War. Today their unfortunate descendants are still soldiers and laborers. In contract law they are 'corporate wards'; slaves owned largely by arms dealers.
Dally Harper starts this story as a champion cage fighter. He is one of the 'lucky' ones. It's all downhill from there.

Content Warning:
Explicit violence and gore, slavery, implied sexual assault.
None of these are framed as positive or glorified, however they do have a strong impact on the plot and main characters.",415
28201,The Immortal Rankings,"The Rankings are simple. They have rules, sure, but everything does; the simplest is that if you want in, you have to kill a Ranked. Deliberately here; first degree matters most. But once you do, you're set for your now eternal life. Just so long as no one else comes by to take your slot.
Even then though, living forever might sound like a good deal, but there are greater prizes higher up, and everyone wants to be Number 1. One gal in particular has her sights on that spot, so feel free to follow along. She's already pretty high up, so there's only fifty more to go.
It should be a fun ride along the way though. Hope you enjoy the fights.

Written by RedKnight3996, The Immortal Rankings is a series of fights loosely connected by a main character and the simple plot of said MC aiming to murder their way to the top of the world. Plus one or two recurring characters.
It started as practice on fight scenes and expanded into a very distracting side project, now posted for the entertainment of those who like fights. Because that's the main thing for this one. Don't expect sensible worldbuilding, it's just violence all the way up, with the occasional bits of humor and character stuff.
Features: fights, gore, unexplained phenomena, a dying planet, capitalists, people that might be ghosts, nanomachines, androids, psychics, wrestlers, cute co-hosts, and increasing absurdity.",33

 Some magic elements are borrowed from Savage Divinity and a handful of other good wuxia/xianxia stories, but the story itself is pretty original if I do say so myself. If you feel bothered by my borrowing elements from other magic systems, a) I'm not making money off of this... yet, and b) almost all Xianxia copy each other.

But, some of these people still got caught in some cameras, making it viral on the internet. But people thought of these as hoax or fake. That's until someone step up and proclaim he is one of the 'specials'. And he called himself, a cultivator. Since then, the cultivators became famous celebrities, anyone wanted to become like them.
A year after the so called cultivators became a norm. A voice spoke to every living person on the planet. Announcing the return of the real and the strongest cultivators. The people who survived fighting different monsters and beast from different dimensions. They are the real cultivators. Among these returnees, there are seventy-two people who stood at the apex of the world. And among these people, there are seven who was known as ""Supremes"".
On top of a city, the space in the sky was ripped and a passage like hole appeared. Then, a man in his mid-twenties fell and landed on top of a building.

28219,Sakura Haruno: Some Flowers Bloom Twice,"In which our resident pink-headed Kunoichi finds herself stuck with a very different ""Inner Sakura"". Bipolar and multiple personality disorder? Sounds like normal neurotypical Shinobi shenanigans to Kakashi and the rest of the village, after all, being normal is overrated and all the truly exceptional Jonins were a little crazy. It was pretty much a requirement at this point.
Naruto is confused, mostly at the mixed signals of his crush, but when is he not? Sasuke isn't quite sure what to make of his female teammate and her seemingly drastic changes in behavior. He decided that this required more observation, preferably from a distance. In other words, shut up and get out of the way.
And Sakura? She was almost tempted to pull her pink hair out at the mess her other self was making of their lives. Kyoka doesn't feel the same. She thinks that a decade of sitting in the back seat watching herself dicking around was quite long enough, especially since Sakura almost got them both killed in Wave. It's time she asserted herself more and get to have a little fun of her own, it's only fair after all.
Maybe she'll even be nice and see if the Uchiha wanted to train together sometimes. She doubted it, but at least she could say she tried.

28234,Old Riding Author Lunatic Asylum,"Just off the A19, in the dark, incomprehensible lands known as Yorkshire, there lies a town. A town where shadow-silent alleys glint with the secret hunger of knives. Where blood soaks the chipboard window shutters of forsaken terraces stretching off into the night. Where the smog-choked air rattles with the depraved laughter echoing out from clubs that can only generously be described as post-apocalyptic.
Well, that’s Middlesbrough. But down the A19 a bit (an impossibly long way down, actually) there lies another town: Raughnen, in the ancient, forgotten Old Riding. It is an equal match in muggery and thuggery alike. It also has magic spells and pointy wizard hats.
And now, across the miles and across all sensibilities, a pretty nasty power (a magic one) calls out for its pretty nasty counterpart (a decidedly unmagic one): a proper sound Boro lad.
Nothing good can come of it.
 

 
This is a collection of one novella and four connected short stories:
 
I. A Yorkshire Summoning
II. Old Riding Day Trip (the novella)
III. Heaven is a Parmo
IV. Death on the 66
V. Death on the 257
In total, this comprises 34 chapters totalling around 35,000 words, so try not to worry. It will be over relatively quickly.
 
There are three more short stories with more tenuous links to the core collection: Rush, Paper Round and Scenario 79: Sausage Fingers, all of which can be found in my collection Short Records of Misadventure. Reading these may allow you to make more sense of certain parts of the story, if any sense is to be made at all.
 

 
NOTE: There are instances of prejudice and discrimination within these stories, including elements of sexism and ageism, which are purely the thoughts and actions of the characters involved and which certainly do not reflect my own views on these matters.
 
ANOTHER NOTE; A WARNING, PERHAPS: This can get a bit weird. In less than 150 pages, we have four viewpoints, first and third person narratives, and a completely disjointed plot with lots of gaps, dead ends and no real resolution. Also ZERO lunatic asylums. It's all a bit odd. If that sort of thing isn't your cup of tea, which it most likely isn't, it might be best to move on now.",6

Some stories will contain mild horror themes. Pertinent content warnings will be enumerated at the top of each story as needed.

Note From The Author:
Hey everybody! Thanks for checking out my story! This is the first time that I'm sitting down to write one out, and it has been a challenge. This story initially started out with the complaint: ""Why don't isekai (portal fantasy) protagonists start in a desert?""
With this one, I wanted to explore how difficult life in a desert could be when you're not a gifted or overpowered main character. I spent a lot of time trying to capture the main character's mindset and because of that, the story is slow, so I'm really looking foward to any critisism the average person might have.
Anyway! Thanks for reading!",5

Mankind lost its dominance over their own planet in a short afternoon, and now Wilfred is one of but a handful of survivors who must make sense of the catastrophic nightmare world that they once called their own.While the Earth is many things after the end, it is anything but the sole domain of humanity. As Wilfred and other survivors discover, their planet was not subject to just one world-ending event, but several. The undead roam the once proud metropolisis, and inhuman beasts stalk the countryside. The physical fabric of reality itself is twisted beyond repair in some places as unnatural distorions that warp physical laws appear across the landscape, and even a simple jog across an empty street can prove fatal to the unwary.The ones who died in the initial catastrophes never had to face the horrors that followed.

********************************
Notes:
If you are looking for lots of fast moving action right away, this story may not be for you.
There is some violence that is visceral and realistic early on.
Some things are not what they appear to be. Character viewpoint narration is not always reliable.
Tropes are cherished, subverted, and then cherished again. Science is used, occasionally misused, but (hopefully) never abused.
This story assumes that humans have the ability to impact the environment on a global scale.
Other tropes and tags beyond those previously noted include:
Young MC, Mystery, System Building, Philosophical Taoism, Gender Ignorance, Science Fantasy, Fantasy Academy, Training from Hell, Dualism, Crafting, Magic, Mild Mind Control, Scientific Terms and Concepts, Computer Overlord
Certain contemporary companies, governments and cultural identities are fictionalized and imagined in a future setting.
There is no sex, and almost no romance.
Updating Sunday, Thursday until further notice.
(And if you actually read all of the above, then this story may be for you)

For centuries, the paranormal world of witches and vampires lived in secret among the humans of the world until a plague the likes of which nobody has seen since ancient times topples society. The infected experience a debilitating fever before dying only to rise again as Ghouls. With grey skin and decaying bodies, Ghouls will attack anyone living including vampires to eat them alive.
The infection spread across the continent of Rueproa, devastating the population so rapidly the Kievenru government had no time to contain the spread with the island nation of Nippon had barely enough time to hastily close their borders. Gaila attempted to establish quarantine zones enforced by the military in an attempt to prevent infection to their neighbors across the channel in the Aventore Republic. The Parlement of the former monarchy sealed the Sealink Tunnel however a lone man stowed away on a goods train brought the sickness to their shores.
The mage going nowhere…
Like most male witches known as a mage, Jack Wolfe was slogging his way through a normal job working as a clerk at a petrol station on the side of the motorway. With his old roommate back in the country from a stint with the Avantore Navy, he just wanted to finish out the week in order to spend the rest of the time celebrating Ford’s return to civilian life. He did not plan to receive a frantic phone call from Valorie Lisbeth of the Witches Council warning him to get as far out into the countryside as possible as the Ghouls were starting to overrun the eastern half of the country. One rescue of Ford’s little sister and her classmates from a herd of Ghouls see him trying to find a sanctuary out at the remote village of Miller’s Run in the heart of the plains.
The vampire wanting to be left alone…
A little less reclusive than witches, the vampires were known for being a race of the night, preying on humans for blood. Of course, they had fallen into the realm of myth and romance fiction which was just fine as far as Violet Kendall was concerned. A solitary hacker, the slender youthful looking vampire preferred avoiding contact with both humans and vampires alike if she could help it. All that was ruined when a call from Casper, a council enforcer, informed her of the outbreak before tasking her with the mission of contacting the witches in an attempt to save as many possible. Grudgingly, she’s now using her motorbike to travel between settlements helping surviving vampires on behalf of the council while searching for her own answers to the Outbreak.

The human outcast facing an incredible journey…
After living on the streets following a fight with his mother’s latest deadbeat boyfriend and being taken in by his veteran uncle, Alex Martin didn’t believe he could find himself in a worse situation. Living on the west coast in Padlowe, he too received a call from Uncle Gideon way up in Tallach Vale at a northern retreat with some fellow veterans. Taking to his uncle’s narrowboat Rogue’s Hope, Alex fled through his hometown via the canals as local guardsmen partnered with the constables declared martial law, instilling roadblocks. As he works his way through lock after lock, he’ll find unlikely allies in those who survived on his trip towards Tallach Vale.",0
28272,Love Of Baybur [Participant in the Royal Road Writathon challenge],"The Sultanate won a huge battle against their enemies of different religion, and now left them with only a piece of land surrounded by Sultanate's forces. Baybur, a yerliyya from a backwater place, is hailed as a hero after the war for his past contributions in a strange manner and is, thus, invited to a banquet prepared by the Sultan and attended by many Great Nobles. To Baybur, who had dreams of stepping on a higher stage in Sultanate's politics, and in his Orta's ranks, this is a chance for him to shine and rise. Yet he, and many in the banquet, knows that victory is far from over. And this presents a chance, with greater risk than before, to impress the Sultan and the Pashas of the Sultanate. Sanjak-beys and Aghas of the Janissary Corps all seek to devour their enemies, both in and out of the Sultanate. And Baybur, in the midst of this brewing storm, is no different from a fish dreaming to be a dragon.  But a woman he meets at the banquet changes everything; his goals, his dreams, and his fate. After all, love, without expression, is a deadly curse.
 
As a note, Cover is not mine obviosuly, and I write this both for NaNoWriMo and Writathon. To some history lovers and nerds who specialize in it, I know you might be angered quite a deal with some things I've written.(I get the feeling when someone talks wrong foolish things in a study I know, no hate) But this is a historical fiction written by a seventeen-year-old, don't expect much from me to know every single detail. Much of my research is surface level and some things are, well, to fit plot, are changed. So bear that in mind.
For schedule/chapter thingt, there will be at most five chapters until I pass the 55.555 words mark. Each chapter will be around or above 10k+ words. It is also not edited, and probably won't be unless I find a great deal of time in my hands after November to see what I lack in where. That's all. Now go read, or leap to another fiction.

It will change your game experience, if not your whole concept of what a ""follower character"" can be.)This was started on the Friends of Inigo Facebook page. So while Inigo is not necessarily the main focus of this series, he will be a staple and a stabilizing factor in the many shenanigans of the argonian known as Rach Wingcutter. (Lydia, a follower from the game is also present, though her nature is determined less by the game and more on the content added, again, by the Inigo mod.)Enjoy!",8

28312,"Evolve, Adapt, and Kill.","First things first, the cover photo is not mine and all credit goes to whoever made it. 

So I wanted to make a novel a little different from others by changing a little itty bitty part of the story. I have always wanted to make a novel where instead of saving the world the mc sides with the monsters. No pretending to be human or bothering to make friends with the humans except for the very beginning parts when he truly is very confused. He is an imp which I don't think I have seen done either, while goblins are close they are very different at the same time. 

The story is as follows: Alexander has his family killed by accident by some idiotic teens and gets sent to another world after he dies in the fire. He is lost and confused in a weird weak tiny body with almost zero magical power. He needs to figure out how to survive in this new terrifying world where everything seems to want to kill him. He grows to want more and more power, almost drunk on it, but not quite as he still has his rationality and reason. He will face hardship after hardship. He works to become the strongest. Will he save all monsterkind from the dreadful humans? Will he die just a few chapters into the story? Read it to find out as I am writing it for myself, not you, so there will most definity be things most others would shy away from. 

There are game elements, war planning, weak to strong mc, graphic language, gore, kingdom building, romance (to the best of my ability), and most of all good ol fashion revenge.

28315,"I'm A Demon Summoner, Damn It!","I want you to imagine this, alright? You're an Arch Demon Summoner. One of the most powerful people to ever exist in your city. You are literally the only one who can even attempt to summon any of the Ninth Circle Demons that even your boss has trouble with. And you've done a good job for over twenty years. Fighting demons, capturing them, and brining them back to the Demon Tech factories that keep your city working. It's cost you one leg and shaved who knowns how many years off your life span, but hey someone's gotta do it.
You'd imagine that eventually you'd get to retire, right? Get to say ""Screw This"" and go spend the rest of your days at home waiting till you finally kick the bucket, while the next Generation deals with this crap?
Well think again. 
Instead your boss sends you over to freaking Angel city, to live with five of their ""Chosen Ones"" that haven't stepped outside of their glowing white city walls since the day they were born, to prevent an ""International Incedent"" from happening!
If you managed to imagine all that, then you've got a perfect picture of the situation I'm in. 
Oh well. I only gotta be here for two years. What the worst that could happen?
...Why did I say that?
Join Crowley as he attempts to keep his mind intact while acting as the only adult in the room to a bunch of naieve Magical Girls and Boys. Will he be able to keep his sanity? Will his presence prevent a War from breaking out? Or will he just make the situation worse?",55

Author's note: this story is a concept. During the first chapter, the main character is faced with a major decision, which will change his life forever, and, not knowing what to do, he decide to play heads or tails, and let fate choose for him. And so there will be two versions of this story, one for each of the result, and their consequences for the main character, as well as all those around him.
Here, he got tails.
Note de l'auteur:
Comme dit plus haut, cette histoire sera en français, car je ne suis pas assez bon en anglais.
De plus, cette histoire est un concept un peu particulier, le personnage principal va se retrouver face à un choix décisif qui va changer sa vie pour toujours, et, ne savant pas que faire, il va jouer  à pile-ou-face, en laissant le destin décider pour lui. Il y a donc deux versions de cette histoire, une pour chacun des résultats de son lancer.
Lien de l'autre version : https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28318/changement-version-face-french
Je vous encourage à ne pas lire les deux versions, ou en tout cas,  à ne pas les lire en même temps. Elle sont assez peu similaires, mais des choses vont, logiquement, être répétées, et les confusions risquent d'être rapides, surtout au début des histoires. Dans tout les cas, ces deux histoires vont s'éloigner assez rapidement, tout en restant intrinsèquement liées par leurs personnage principal. Libre à vous de choisir la version qui vous plaît le plus, sachant que vous n'aurez pas besoin de lire les deux pour comprendre toutes les intrigues, elles sont absolument indépendantes l'une de l'autre.
Le seul chapitre identique dans les deux versions est le prologue.
C'est la deuxième fois maintenant que je publie quelque chose que j'ai écrit, mais ça ne me rends pas meilleur en terme d'orthographe et de grammaire, donc si vous relevez une erreur, où même si vous remarquez des incohérences, n'hésitez surtout pas à me le faire remarquer. Toute critique, qu'elle soit positive ou négative, est appréciée.
En terme de rythme de publication, je pense sortir un chapitre par semaine dans chacune des deux histoires.",2

28320,How To Wear A Crown,"Jules and Nia Parin died together, but their souls took a different path than the usual.  Their time had not yet come; and so they were reborn, reincarnating into a new world together. They were warped and twisted by the passage, and so it came to pass that they had the soul-shells of World-Titans trapped within mortal flesh. Of course, such a unique existence is no pure boon. Mortal flesh means mortal frailties, and Immortal souls mean Immortal enemies. 
But this is not the story of how these two siblings struggle in a strange world. This is not the story of how they are ruled by fear, of how they are hounded at every turn and run for their lives. This is not the story of those who bow to fate.
This is the story of how they make the world quake in their passing. This realm is not prepared for what they dare to do.",5

28325,"Saga of Fallen Kings, Book I: The Revenant Prince","The Philosopher King once conquered the known world, his power seemingly unlimited and his armies inexhaustible. Since that time his might has slowly unravelled, and his once steadfast empire has begun to crack, splinter and devour itself.
In the isolated Southern Realms, where even magic has abandoned them, none of that matters. For years it has been filled with warring kingdoms, where as many kings die to the blade as to old age, and constant battles tear apart the land. When one such kingdom invades its old enemy, the King and his heir, Prince Caden, are killed. Unable to accept the loss of his family Prince Arian is broken, and when the Philosopher King stretches out his hand in aid, Arian takes it without a second thought.
When Caden wakes from death, he's different. His eyes and soul have changed, and he finds a world filled with friends who no longer trust he's even human. Suddenly thrust onto the throne and indebted to the Philosopher King, Caden has no choice but to keep going - he must finish what his father started, and try to survive the machinations of the figure who now owns his fealty. Meanwhile something beyond death stirs for him, desiring nothing more than to drag him back into its embrace. 



Author's Note:
This story used to be known as ""A King of his Own"", but after some consideration I have decided to rebrand it. The first reason is that I was growing increasingly dissatisfied with the title. The second is that I have come increasingly to view this story as a 'saga' containing multiple 'books' rather than one long, continuous publication, and as I did so I realized that as I was quickly getting to a point in the story where I wanted the first 'book' to end. This doesn't mean I'm going back on the things I said below - they're just going to continue in the next book of the Saga of Fallen Kings. :) 
Also, be aware that I do plan to edit this at some point. Though I take care to squash out any obvious errors when I proof-read, and do simple edits in that process, at some point I'm almost certainly going to do large edits that might significantly change parts of the story. 
Old author's notes: 
This started as a completely random writing session. There was no purpose or direction, but as I kept typing an entire world began to form in my mind that I knew I had to write about. My plan is to turn this story into a veritable medieval fantasy epic that spans an entire world, follows multiple character and storylines, and takes place over many years. The story has quite a grounded, almost 'realistic' start, but many more fantastical elements will be introduced, expanded upon and become central to the narrative. I have ideas for this story that make me genuinely excited and I hope you enjoy my work as much as I enjoy writing it, and join me on what will hopefully become a truly massive fantasy epic. 
If you do enjoy this story please consider following, rating and leaving a review. I'm also happy to answer any questions or comments you have.

- Work is very stressful right now. I don't think I'll be keeping a regular release schedule, but I'll release a new chapter when I can.

Schedule Notes:
- Going back to once a week for now.

[ Thank you for your patience and support as I improve my writing and storytelling abilities. I'm also using this story to better develop lore that extends far beyond it. ]

Thanks to an exceptionally talented artist, Hiroeth, Blightbane has an official cover!


Vera was alone again.
“You’re completely unprepared. Never before has sending one of you off made me feel quite so guilty.”
Whenever she found herself in doubt, she would weigh her actions against the guiding principles of the one whom she revered.
“When you don’t know the rules of the game, start making them up. When you are constrained by unfavorable conditions, inject a little chaos.”
It was the supplementary message that concerned Vera the most. It was difficult to follow because it was intentionally vague and mired in subjectivity.
“How can I enjoy myself when you look so tormented? Are we in danger?”
Vera fell silent.


An experiment is taking place on a planetary scale.
Across the surface of the planet, a phenomenon referred to as ""Blight"" is spreading. Festering regions defended by fierce creatures called “blightbeasts” taint the surface, warping the land and proliferating unceasingly. Among the sentient creatures of the planet, it is the Blightbane Guild’s responsibility to stem the tide. They endeavor to cleanse the land in a struggle of attrition, but they are losing ground.
A young man named Caim has been uprooted from his former life and transported to The Shrouded Theocracy, an isolationist nation with fanatical policies. He must struggle to survive with only an unfamiliar strain of magic to aid him. There is a secret to this magic. One he knows very little about. He intends to explore just what makes this magic special.
On the far border of the theocracy, a mage scientist named Inis discovers a revolutionary new way to infuse strength from defeated blightbeasts. Using herself as a test subject, this process allows her to grasp magical concepts previously thought beyond her reach. Though she tries to document any side effects that arise, something escapes her awareness. She is playing with a dangerous force that will claim her most treasured asset if she isn't careful.
Everyone and everything on the planet is a part of the experiment. The experiment is a lie.",147

THIS is NOT deadalus. This is NOT THE MECH TOUCH. This is an independent work by myself. I've more then a few times explained that I've been expired by these incredible novels but they are very different. MC is not as smart as Deado. There is no System.  The setting is similar - because, well, its a SCI-FI Mech novel. What am I to do about that? Some people judge at chapter one, five or ten. I would like those who decide to drop this novel and drop a 1 or 2 to read chapters 27 or 28 or 29. On a positive note; I really don't need to defend my work or myself. I'm very satisfied with the progress lately. Im happy with the continued support. Im happy to have become a Webnovel Contracted Author. I'm happy to have +/- 350 collections on WN.

28399,A Nerd's Wet Dream Come True (Tossing an OC into Marvel) V2.,"Andrew William. A perfectly average boring name for a perfectly average and boring boy. He wasn't particularly smart nor gifted. Not in academics nor in sports. He wasn't even as good as the other losers and ""nerds"" in his school. He could not remember the expansive lore of Star Wars, he could not recite the dialogue of Startek nor pull off any cool one-liners and quotes, and he couldn't beat the final level in most games without resorting to cheating or mods.
All he had was half-assed knowledge of pop culture and comics, but the one thing he was good at, his one and only pride and calling in life? Making Youtube videos. 
No, it wasn't sad!
He was actually quite popular, honest! 
He made videos of adventure and nature, although it was mostly of the creepy variety. Abandoned hospitals, old mines, long tunnels, and undiscovered caverns.
And as ironic as it was predictable, it would, of course, turn out to be the reason that he died. Well, at least he could take comfort in dying doing what he loved, not many people these days could say the same, you know?
The concept comforted him at least, but it turns out death is not always as permanent as people liked to think, because Andrew somehow found himself in New York City of all places after falling to his certain death in the Devil's hole, Death Valley Nevada., only thing was it certainly wasn't the New York that he knew of.
The Fantastic Four? Stark Industry? Captain America's biography? Oh boy, and did he mention he's no longer human? His Asian friends had introduced him to the wonders of Isekai novels and mangas, but isn't the order a little messed up? Where's his meeting with the sexy and nice Goddess? Where was his intro or tutorial?? Explanation plz I'm a noob at cross-dimensional travel! Help? Setting? Menu? Status?
May I please get to pick my own cheat power? No? I'm stuck as a virus? Well, At least the Prototype Virus was pretty darn cool and OP. Just not as op as being able to casually break the sound barrier in my sneakers or bench pressing the earth, but I'll just have to make do. Please don't be some fucked up Marvel continuity where Nazis and Hydra won or some shit.

28402,Gods How I Hate Nature,"While there are always choices in life, lately they’ve all tended to skew between bad, terrible, and suicidal.  Tome finds himself typically choosing the latter.  As if people and plants consistently trying to kill him wasn’t bad enough, he finds himself sent off to a Mage Spire along with a self-righteous other worlder (as though there were any other kind).  Add to this some powerful figures in black, a sadistic instructor, an uptight law keeper, and Tome just wants to go back to his room, down a pint, and forget about everything…

But, when someone starts a fight, especially someone bigger and stronger, you bide your time and strength.  Before you can get revenge, you have to settle for surviving and slowly gaining power.

That means accepting the most suicidal choices, doing the jobs no one else will do, always smiling, and not slitting that other worlder’s throat…

(The story will incorporate comedy, but it will be a dark story.  This won't be a happy, uplifting tale, but it also won't be too morose or depressing.  Though if you're rooting for the other worlders, then I suppose it will be...)",250

Zombies, robots, and aliens are only the first enemies they fight in what wil become humanity's long war or last stant against to a hostile universe.

Okay, so although this novel rework based on an Adult Game in development called Divine Adventures, it will not contain as much as 18+ scenes as the original novel did.

About the Author
This is my first novel or any attempt to write something so I'm pretty much a newbie trying to pen down the fantasies rolling in my mind. 
English isn't my First language so brace yourself for some grammatic potholes. But I'm genuinely working on improving my English but it won't be happening overnight as it's a process, I guess. (for the time being, I'm trying to make it readable with some Grammar checking software)
Moreover, I wish to improve my writing skills as the story grows and readers help in spotting mistakes or critics might turn it into a reality.",21
28426,Skylet - Schizoid Isekai Journey Novel,"Skylet is transported to a magical realm and meets Matthew, who urges him to unlock his inner strength. He discovers his own powerful magic but struggles to control it, fearing harm to villagers. Tasked with defending them from monsters, Skylet embarks on a journey of self-discovery and survival in this wondrous yet perilous world.
Skip the prologues and head over to chapter 1 if you want to get right into the main story. The prologue just delves more deeply into Skylet's perspective back on Earth, so it is very fragmented and non-linear and poetic, philosophical, emotional, and abstract.

28432,The London Phantom: A Superhero Webnovel,"London is an old city.
It has survived floods, fires, plagues and the man-made smog of industry. It has stood firm against the armies of Vikings, Saxons, Normans and the aerial might of the Luftwaffe. It has borne witness to dynsatic feuds, civil wars, military occupation and the sin of regicide. Through all these disasters the city has survived not through force of arms, though its walls were once the envy of the world, but through adapting to the times. Enemies become dependant on the city, and the wealth of the world that flows through it, and so become new allies. If the rulers change, then the city welcomes them with open arms, and open lines of credit. In this way the city seeks to preserve its ancient rights and position of power.
Superheroes are a new phenomenon.
The first superpowered man walked out of the Nevada desert in 1950, and the world was forever changed. Across the planet, men and women with exceptional abilities made themselves known. At first, they were little more than another source of fear in the era of Mutually Assured Destruction, but over time attitudes changed and the concept of the Superhero was created in the city of Los Angeles. From there the phenomenon spread across the globe; superheroes went from being feared arms of the state to a symbol of hope in these maddening times.
Times have changed.
Sixty years from the emergence of the first superhero, the City of London stands on a precipice. Two years have passed since the madman Fawkes nearly brought down the United Kingdom and the remnants of the Bow Street Runners, London's premier superhero team, are struggling to keep order in a city that seems on the brink of collapse.

28436,In Another World with the God of Death (Dropped),"DROPPED.
I feel bad for anyone who read this, but I'm going to have to revise this novel.
After outlining the next arc, I realized it had a Two very big problems:
1- The world got too big too fast.  I was relieved to finally get all the half finished story ideas out, and didn't take time to pace the buildup of the world, so it ended up being a confusing mess--not at all what I wanted.
2- Even more importantly, there is no main character.  This isn't bad in itself, but the two I have hoisted as the mains are actually side characters.  That was one of the hardest parts I was having with drafting the next arc.  Basically, I was having to fix my main characters 40 chapters in, trying to coax them into empatheic characters without actually retconning their backstory.
And if the main characters aren't empathetic after 240 pages, it's safe to say they are failed characters.
More than anything, I was am amateur diving in head-first, and after 70K words, I have a much better feel for what to do.  Basically, don't bite off more than I can chew!
I'm not abandoning this setting or the characters, just starting over and focusing on a single main character.
I decided to make Donny (the kid with the mullet from Jimmy's guild) the main character, and it'll follow him as he weaves his way through the plot that's already set up.
I think Loogman and Eta will make for some great side characters, but not mains.  They're basically gag characters, and that's depressing after spending so much time working out their story.  However, they certainly won't be shallow characters, I have 240 pages of character development and probably that same amount in notes.  I just have to add another character to the mix.
Sorry for wasting your time with this.
I'll leave the story up for another month before sending in a support ticket to see if they can remove it.
Hopefully you give me another shot, but if not that's understandable, too.  I think it'd be far worse to continue a novel that needs invisibly retconned after 40 chapters than start over from scratch.
If you really wanted to finish this, the latest arc was completed, but to avoid confusion, I took the chapters off RR.  It's still up on ScribbleHub under the same name, though.",14

On his first day in the game, he's betrayed for loot, killed, and even made to suffer.
Unknown to these players, Colin (DevilWalker in-game) was an Assassin for hire that takes loyalty and betrayal seriously. It was never just about business, and this was not just another aspect of the game for him. This game was a gift from his wife, and he wasn't just going to stop.

Longer Synopsis:
Witnessing his parents being killed in front of him, Liam unknowingly changed the way he thought about the world, while still having the thought of making the killers pay for what they had done to completely messed up his life.
But time still passes as well as the emotions and beliefs that one had felt before... Unless something happened that made them want to remember that tragic moment.
Exactly 5 years later after that day, Liam suddenly saw a window floating in front of him. A system. The one thing he thought that could change his life.
Oddly enough, several minutes after that, his friend came to him with men from a dangerous organization on his trail. And later, he learned that this organization was the same one that ordered people to kill his parents.
""Starting today until the day you die. We will be chasing you and we will try to kill you with our own hands whatever it takes.""
Just like the man said to him, since that day, as he kept walking forwards, he would just go deeper and deeper into the filth and danger of the world his living in. His once-peaceful life became a chaotic mess that he would have to fix with nothing but his blood and sweat. And the system.

28517,The Tower,"The Tower is the first release of the series. Due to community guidelines the PG rated version is here on Royal Road.  The as released, un-edited version is available on my personal site.
How does the world react when it is unwillingly inducted into a universal framework?
Jacob is a complicated man. The regret of a lost love and misplaced trust has lingered with him for far to long causing him to withdraw from the community that should have been his salvation.
Today, everything changes, because apparently… life is just one big game. The universal framework has randomly chosen Jacob to be a Dungeon Master in this new world. Whilst he’s use to being addressed as Master by his pets thanks to his previous life, he isn’t particularly looking forward to living out the rest of it… however long that might be… as a series of interconnected walls.
The Tower will explore the world after indoctrination into the system that is the universal framework.

On the one-year anniversary of Epilogue, Etzy's back <3
This story is a proto-cyberpunk thriller set in near-future Seattle. As with all my stories, the focus is on characters above everything. This is one of the more-action heavy stories I've written—but as always, expect a lot of dialogue, realistic characters, and complicated drama without easy answers. There's no gore and I don't describe violence in explicit detail, but my stories do tend toward the darker side of life, so please be aware as you dive in.
Chapters whenever I publish them, no specific schedule. I hope you enjoy! Let me know what you think :)
Special thanks, as always, to my good friends Ace Arriande, Reaver, ThinkTwice, and FortySixtyFour, and to the patrons who have stuck with me through all my work. i love you <3

Hello all reading this! This is the old version of Cutest in the Omniverse as I am currently rewriting everything in the new book by the same name, you can check my profile for the link! 
The new book would be better planned out as originally I had minimal planning and thus made it harder for it to last long with improper planning and though Cutest in the Omniverse would be quite an open novel with a lot of ideas i wanted to write, it wouldn't be well written IMO and I'd lose motivation from being unable to keep track of everything.

Ten years ago, in a world not so different from our own, people with powerful abilities appeared. The new powers were dangerous, dangerous to acquire—dangerous to have—dangerous to wield. World governments raced to find and eradicate the abilities and those who possess them while using the media to rule by fear. Whereas corporations sought to exploit the abilities for profit.

This story is written in third person limited POV. That means you can expect to know many of the thoughts and inner dialog of one character, and only see the actions of other characters. This POV does include scenes without the main character, and thus the reader can and will know things the main character does not. Further, this means characters act on what they know, which is almost always less than the reader knows.

Something else to know. These books do not hold your hand. If you're reading it and thinking ""Gosh, why aren't 'they' doing some 'obvious' thing."" Bad news. You probably missed something that explains exactly that. If you're seeking a light read that doesn't ask much of you as the reader, you're invited and very welcome to come on in, but this might not be the story for you.","1,058"

Except, when he actually looks into the risks and the rewards he discovers that being a hero is not really worth it.  Being a villain, on the other hand, certainly pays well.  If you don't mind risking being sent to prison and being hunted by heroes and other villains.  Max, not being an idiot, does mind both of those things.  Instead of being a hero or being a villain, Max decides to take the third option, to be a vigilante!  His plan?  To hit the criminals in the gut and run off with their money, making the world a bit brighter at the same time by taking down the bad guys.
But how long can he actually manage alone?  Can he really navigate through the dangerous world of supers and capes without declaring for either heroes or villains?  Or will he be sucked into the web of plots and drama that is the life of those with superpowers?

28645,TwinSoul: Fractured Mind,"Apparently Isais is the chosen one. Only nobody told him. Or if they did, he can't remember. And the only thing he has for guidance is a voice that seems to be inhabiting his body. Or perhaps it’s another soul. Whatever it is, it results in him talking to himself a lot. And it seems far more interested in mocking Isais than actually helping him. Still, when you awaken naked, memoryless and alone in a dungeon, it’s a sure sign that life has a way of throwing up unexpected surprises.
With no memory of himself, or anything else, Isais has little choice but to trust the voice and his instincts. However, after discovering his magic abilities and fighting his way through the dungeon he receives a cryptic message that sets him on a path to recovering his memories. All he has to do is find a woman with no name, stop a man with no name and fight his way through monsters, evil spellcasters and murderous armies. Simple, right? Fortunately, if Isais and the readers play their cards right, he’ll have the help of strange new companions he meets along the way. Perhaps, together, they’ll be enough to withstand the might of whichever powerful enemy is determined to see Isais dead.
With no memory, no trousers and a slightly sadistic berserker inhabiting his body, Isais’ journey is guaranteed to be full of adventure- assuming he can survive long enough to see it through.",12

Yet in the background, the immortals of previous eras awaken, magic continues to grow yet disapear, prophets arise claiming to carry the will of the earth, and an age long plot for revenge inches nearer to a climax.
There will be many mysteries, but one certainty:  this is the story of a small boy with grand dreams, destined to walk where others have not.

Even though he was the captain of the tennis club and set to go to enter the youth Olympics team, no one wanted to date him because the moment he opened his mouth, his conceited and bossy attitude would make people stay away from him within a three meter radius.
In this alternate universe, the Gods of this world gives all the people ‘roles’ to play that are similar to that of roles characters fall under in video games or movies. People know about the details of the game through game menus that only the people involved can see. Completing that role well is rumored to give amazing benefits and even eternal happiness.
Apparently at the age of 17, Ace finally received a role, of Love Rival to make the main protagonist unable to romance any of the love interests in the dating sim. For once in his life, Ace decided to not be a dick and interfere with the love of other people, choosing to support the main protagonist and the love interests as much as possible. For the first time in his life, he thought, wow it actually doesn’t feel bad to be a good guy for once.
System Announcement: Congratulations, Ace! You have just completed your role as ‘Love Rival’ and managed to break up their relationship! You have earned 100 000 points!

And he hadn’t planned on joining a strange organization based in another world, thanks to which he flies off to a private island to suffer weeks of grueling training and endure intensive foreign language study the likes of which he hasn’t experienced since high school.

No one ever knows the whole story. 
 
Deep in the forests of the Pacific Northwest, the fading town of Rallsburg stumbles upon an amazing discovery—magic itself. Faced with potentially world-shattering power, the people of Rallsburg keep the secret for themselves. Led by Rachel DuValle, a perpetually underestimated college student with grand ambitions, they seek to found a new society.
The world beyond suspects nothing, but magic cannot stay hidden forever. A train arrives in Rallsburg carrying Alden Bensen, a directionless high school graduate. To him, magic could represent meaning for his life, an explanation for his empty existence. This potent force offers anyone the power to change humanity forever—or send it cascading into swift and total annihilation.
 

 
The Last Science is an ongoing science-fiction / low-fantasy web novel series, focused on the modern world with a twist. New societies bud and grow, but the people who make them up are imperfect and flawed. The story includes elements of mystery, action, crime, interpersonal drama, relationships, philosophy, sociology, politics, and much more, all centered on the perspective characters driving the tale. 
This is the ""Scraps Edition"" of the story, where the chapters have been split up into bite-size chunks (roughly 1500-3000 words), for your convenience. The prose has been edited from its original form, with some improvements, but there are no content differences from the original. New chapters will be posted throughout each week starting on Friday and appearing on multiple days thereafter, depending on the length of the chapter. 
Content Warning (by request): This series delves into some topics and situations which may be upsetting for some readers. In American rating parlance, the narrative would be rated PG-13 (except for language), but some have noted the story can get pretty dark on occasion. Please use your best judgment, and don't be afraid to take breaks and come back later. I'll still be here!

28690,An islander's Meta-journey,"This is a fanfiction using Wutosama's Metaworld Chronicles 's world and magic system, which is itself inspired respectively from the real world and Dungeon and Dragons.

28691,Viceroy's Pride,"This story could be about the Tellask Empire, ruler of a thousand suns and faced with imminent peril at the hands of the Orakh hordes.  It could be about Paltai Amberell, the scion of a noble elven House, fallen upon hard times and seeking to find the key that will restore his family's name and save the Empire itself.  It could be the story of his voidship, The Viceroy's Pride, powered by magic and crewed by a team of crack marines as they search for adventure and the solution to the Empire's myriad problems.
Instead, this is the story of Daniel Thrush, human electrical engineer, befuddled researcher and survivor of the debacle that was first contact with a spacefaring civilization. Due to a combination of luck, magic, hard work, and more luck he is thrust into the center of events as Earth is shoved onto a much larger stage rife with semi-immortal elves and magical kingdoms that predate the Earthly invention of agriculture.
Earth is outnumbered, and we have precisely one wizard.  Dan.  He's not very good at it, but he's going to have to learn in a hurry or watch everything he knows get torn apart by massive spacefaring empires straight from the pages of a fantasy novel.
----------
Some readers have noted that the MC tends to be weak willed and pushed around a bit.  A significant portion of the story is his character growth into not being a pushover (i.e. him being passive is in the early chapters on purpose).  I'm just including this caveat/warning to make sure that readers aren't surprised/upset and that they stick with it until he learns to stand up for himself.
His arc begins to crystallize around chapters 25-27.  If that's too long to wait, I get it, I'm just trying to do my due diligence and warn you that the character development is a bit of a slow burn.
This is NOT a harem novel.  Nothing against them, just not what it is.

28692,Micah Ever After,"[Note: New chapters will not be released on this site anymore, nor will previous chapters receive any edits or updates. To continue reading beyond chapter 6, please use this link to find MEA on Scribble Hub. Sorry for the inconvenience.]
Sawatari Mikasa was a normal high school girl.
She was great at sports, had above-average grades, lots of friends, and a little brother that she loved more than anything in the world. To Mikasa, life couldn't be more perfect.
That is, until the day she received the phone call that shattered her world.
""Yuu has been hospitalized.""
Her precious younger brother, Yuu. In a fit of panic, Mikasa raced towards the hospital to check on him.
But her negligence threw her straight into the path of an oncoming car...
And that was how the girl known as 'Sawatari Mikasa' lost her life.
When she awoke, she found herself before the being known as 'God', who presented her a second chance at life in a new world. She accepted, and only had one question:
""What happened to Yuu?""
But God would not give her an answer, and before she knew it she was being reborn in a world of monsters and magic straight out of a fantasy novel.
However, she wouldn't be satisfied with that.

28699,The Day the King Died,"In a dark cell, chained, sat a broken man. Footsteps thumped down the hastily built hallway leading to his lonely cell. Heavy footsteps bore the burden of the man who had killed his father, the king. A flickering light finally bounced energetically against the far wall beyond the cell bars its energy contrasting that of the defeated chained soldier. The kingslayer emerged with a torch and a bowl. He placed the pitch-covered stick in a holder on the wall opposite the candle. 
He fished for his key and slid it into the padlock on the iron gate that stood between him and the beast he had created. 
""How did it come to this?"" Said the man, gripping one of the cell bars with one hand. The man chained to the wall did not respond. He hung his head and his gaze stared into space.The cell door swung open with a shrieking whine and the bowl made a soft click as it was placed on the ground. The betrayer pushed it into the cell with his foot.
The man looked to the crouched figure, the general. ""Soon, we will be at the very gates and all made possible because of you."" He closed the cell and locked it. “My father was worried about the dwarves. He was afraid that you had lost your bite. That the army was tired and homesick.” 
He turned and grabbed the torch from its holder. He sighed. ""I know he was like a brother to you. I know you would have - did - go to hell and back for him, but he wasn't the man you grew up with.""
“We could have conquered it all. You could have served me like you served him.”
The generals head raised slightly. “You knew what would happen when you killed him,” The chained man’s voice rattled and scratched from a dry throat. “You knew how I would feel.” Anger creeped into the unsettling mixture in his voice.
“You’re right. I knew what you would do the day the King died. I just wish -”
The chained man laughed at the remorse he heard. “The day you killed him!” The chained general accused him venomously. 
The betrayer continued ignoring the accusation. “I wish you could know what I know, see what I have seen.” 
“You should kill me while you still have the chance!” The chained man bellowed. His captor turned away and his shoulders drooped as he turned back to the stairs, his footsteps heavier than when they came.",2

The silence of the halls, that lasted for 13 long years
. I do not mind at all, for it was all part of my revenge
. I do not mind, my carefully sewn lips opening in front of a stranger prince, uttering lying words as I speak for the first time in forever.
 “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Julian, I hope we will have the best relationship ever.” I would say, as I clutch his hands in my gloved ones, happily taking him around my home.
 I do not mind the lies, as I carefully sharpen my blades, ready for the attack that would give me everything, the throne, my vengeance, my voice.
 But what’s this?
 I am not the only one who is lying. 
No, someone in this castle, this building, is carrying a filthy sack of untruths that would bring my plan crashing down.
 “Aurelia, I’m so glad I met you...”
 But somethings holding me back from finding them.
 Somethings holding me back as my castle walls crumble and foreigners overtake the rooms, and as I slowly fall from the princess to the criminal.

Long story short I am old and powerful. I would be called an Eldritch Abomination by many among you. This however is not my story. This is the story of my favourite human, a man who managed to surpass my expectations until the day of his death. A man to whom I personally taught the deepest secrets of Creation.
The story of my Disciple, born to a world within the Fayd. A man who was called many names. Godkiller, Guardian of the Gates of Death, My Left Hand, Destroyer, The End by his enemies. That Crazy Dude by his allies. I call him Sam-Sam, mainly to annoy him.

John Iverson is just that idiot. Running out of money and prospects, he took a job for janitorial work, listed at twice minimum wage, with one provision: No questions asked or answered.

Most people would recognize that such a thing should be kept secret, and that sharing sensitive information obtained in the line of duty would be an extremely terrible and unsafe idea.
John is not most people.
In fact, he's more the sort of person to use his newfound knowledge to pedantically correct people on the internet, and then bask in e-fame.

I always liked portal fantasy and the situations the characters can get into. But I liked the ones where they find themselves in a different/monster/dungeon body the best, as it was completely different and exciting. A flaw in my eyes was how, most of the time, the characters get either stupidly overpowered without a good reason or they get the attention of the entire world within a month, or they get in the way of an evil organisation set on felling the country.
So don't expect that, the character progress won't be that fast and no world saving should happen.

 All this changed in the 11th grade when his mother got him a grey sweatshirt made of an unknown extremely absorbent material. However, this didn’t alleviate any of the heat he felt, but actually made it worse.

Tips to reading:
This is my first book, so cliches and tropes are used as the base and then expanded upon. My intention is to make it a casual read but deep if you decide to look closer. I'm not a people person, so my focus and purpose for writing this is to explore the world building and magic system, not necessarily the characters. There won't be a villian until the postgame ;)

Author's philosophy:
I took an professional personality inventory (through a community college back in 2018) and was categorized as a ""double-checker."" I'm never satisfied with the work that I complete, and never want to share it with anyone. But this book is a challenge to myself! As a rule of thumb, I will only add to the story. I can't remove elements I've already included (unless absolutely, absolutely necessary).

Time is an ever-winding path that stretches out into infinity, leaving behind all those that walked it for an unnoticeably small period. Their crumbling bones that paved the way the only sign, the only fading memory of their existence.  
Few get the chance to truly witness how small they are, how painfully inconsequential their lives are - that knowledge signifying the end for many. Yet fewer still get the chance to overcome that limitation and walk in step with time.
But He did.
Be it a curse or a gift, He got the chance to come back. To live once again in a world that has grown foreign, unfamiliar during His absence. The conflicts and apocalyptic clashes of wild magic – nothing but a distant memory, echoes of faded glory rotting away in forgotten ruins.
Magic was tamed now. Chained. Safer. Available to the wider masses to be used for the mundane, played around like a child would with pets. Yet even a domesticated animal could bare its fangs when cornered, could bite the hand that holds its chain firmly.
Already the air shakes as its low growl sounds, like an ominous sign, a premonition of a calamity to come. A calamity He would need to face.

“The revolt of humanity”, a recent event that will be forever etched in history books, when humanity rose against the Gods and enslaved them. Shattering their bodies and scattering them towards the masses, humanity used them to obtain power and fulfill their heart’s desires.

With memories of the Revolt still burning within his mind, Fleck goes around the world working as a member of the Church of the Fallen Gods. They have one mission only: To put back together every shattered God and return them to the Empyrean, homeland of the Gods. Known as a lone wolf by other members of the Church, Fleck willingly takes on the most dangerous missions, always reaching a little bit for the right that Goddess Ereshkigal, leader of the Church, has taken away from him: Death…

For that darkness’ cold lull to ease his burden and keep away the burning flames in his mind…

When a mission that looks simple enough comes to Fleck, a mission that will take him on another journey, he takes it on without much thinking. With the sky suddenly turns crimson, a sky under which he will have to move in his travel in the company of Hashi, a woman of the rarest beauty, a mysterious past and a prosthetic arm, Fleck will come to face situations that are increasingly far out of his control, bringing life and death, past and future together, being thrown entirely into the flames…

A journey where he may lose the flames of his mind, losing his humanity in the progress… and given a death worse than street dogs.

28893,The Genesis Tales,"This is a collection of one-shots, flash fictions and short stories from my wider Genesis universe.
Before we begin, a note on how the timeline of these stories will work.

These stories are set in a world where humans have been, for a very long time, playing with their genome. It all started once upon a time... In a story that I will tell you later. 

Suffice to say for now that in the calendar used here, the year of Genesis is the year when it all came out into the open. For the first time in history, humans that were not quite human anymore were walking among us.

Anything before that year is marked in this calendar as ""Before Genesis"" or, B.G. for short. Anything that happened afterward until the present time, is marked ""Post Genesis"" or, P.G.

I will be writing in these stories predominantly about things that happened P.G. as these new races tackle coming to terms with their existence, and finding a place in this world that I call Gaia, which they can call home.

Thank you so much for joining me on this journey. 

I hope you all enjoy reading them as much as I love writing them.

This collection of works is written entirely by me, and is owned by me.",0
28896,Late Guest,"In the Space age of humanity or some may call it Type 1.7 civilization we exploited asteroids and other planets for resources and archived short-range jump, made it safe and energy-efficient to travel between planets in minutes but it was not enough we wanted it longer, faster ship. But there is no breakthrough without failing countless times. This is what happened to our protagonist: everything was going all according to plan. Testing showed good results our latest model jumped edge of our solar system and got back. Everyone had good expectations in live testing. The expermental ship departed from the orbital station, operators helped him calibrating the destination of the jump. He's going to jump over 4 planets first so it was Uranus.
""Good luck and godspeed"" Commander said to pilot and scanned the pre-jump testing data ""begin the countdown""
""10. 9. 8. 7. 6."" already full of energy warp drive created a subspace
""5. 4. 3. 2. 1 Jump!""
The ship jumped but gone no feedback no sighting of the ship in destination Uranus.

Decided to abandon the isekai tag.
This fiction is on the materialist side so there is no god deity, overseer.
I tough this fiction might be misleading without a magic tag.
There is no incantation, no funny dance, hand movement (My finger is faster than YOURS!), and leveling system.
I might die from losing too much brain cells but hey I'm doing it for fun.
No schedule (yet) and some chapters might go under modification a dozen times before I am satisfied.

Hi RoyalRoaders, about how I'll be releasing chapters, I've learned a lesson from writing my previous story on RR, trying to maintain a weekly schedule while struggling with work and health. After receiving valuable feedback, I've decided to try writing at least a complete story arc, then start posting, editing each chapter as I go. That way, I won't leave readers hanging for too long, and at least there will be some resolution in between breaks. Hope this works better! :)
To those who've DM'ed me corrections and feedback (including one who was quite, er, passionate about the topic) or commented, or rated, thank you, I appreciate you all so much. If one day, there was someone so awesome as to review my story, whew, my gratitude would overflow like the banks of the River Huang.

But to his surprise, he discovers that, unlike gods, mortals and magic rarely fit together smoothly.

Author's Notes:
Readers would have to forgive me if the installments for this story won't be as regular as the others. The other stories take precedence, of course, being way ahead in the queue. This story will also appear on my Patreon page and chapters there will be ahead of those posted on RRL.
The genre is classic dark fantasy, where the morality of the story is driven by the nature of the main character.

28903,Falling in Love with The First King - Draft,"He saw the title and read it outloud “The First King”? Then he turned it around to read the summary. The text made his heart beat faster. This sounded so interesting!
The summary told of a world where the strong survive and powerful thrive, filled with pillage, murder, drama, castles and dinosaurs. How fricking cool is that!? This makes one's blood boil with ambition and excitement! And it’s all in a medieval setting.
But the book's ending was rotten... William took his anger out on the book but was paid back tenfold. When he realized it, it was too late: ""What!? I'm reborn as a girl in this crazy world!? Book! You really want to see me suffer don't you!?"".
Warning: Contains mentions of rape, family abuse and cruel scenes...

His only goal? To be left alone so he can govern over his poor, ravaged Province in peace.
And so, yeah, the last thing he wanted, was to become some Celestial’s Chosen One.

Snow has lived most of his life locked in a dark room, explored and sold for his miraculous blood. There are a lot of things he does not understand about the outside world. But one thing is certain.

28915,The Yes-Mage,"Plenty of people have stopped and asked what it'd be like to simply have everything, and Sylvain Henry Camille Johansson was no different. He was a man who had a lot of things going on, with a name that'd make a supervillain blush and a family who'd make even the useless of their rank into someone important. It was a shame, then, that he was slapped with a dreadfully unfortunate condition that kept him from living up to any of those already low expectations.
Stuck living a life where magic is everywhere while he's left working with nothing more than a moderate intellect, a little bit of whatever influence he could get from his family, and a lifetime's practice at making himself the ideal subordinate for his bosses' boss, Vane was still beating the odds and slowly working his way up in the world. When the cunning yes-man finally got a chance to really make a name for himself, he leapt at the offer, taking his first real step onto a road he knew he was always meant to walk. His goal? Nothing less than finding out why he and too many other unfortunate souls are barred from the wonderful world of the higher energies, and with any luck, fixing it.

Of course, life has a knack for interfering in even the humblest of plans, and Vane's lofty ideals were anything but humble; he was practically a walking bullseye for disaster. The funny thing about catastrophe, though, is that nobody can ever say what form it's going to take. That’s why, when it all went wrong for Vane, he'd gotten everything he'd ever wanted foisted onto him, and Everything else, too. Watch as a man so used to saying 'yes' to everyone above him finds himself stuck with the power to make reality itself say it back.",396

Wait, you're still here?The synopsis is supposed to be over, why are you still here? Go on, scram. Read the book or something.
Honestly, what am I supposed to say here? Do I give a list of characters, because I'm sure you'd love to read about a spider, a demon, and a rapist. Maybe plot? Then again I just described it up there, what more do you want? Do you want me to say something about the guns, or the seduction powers, or the power of friendship/lack thereof? Surely you see something that makes you want to read this. Anything? Maybe you just want a nice little story to read, in which case can you just open the god damn book already? 
Anyways that's it, end of the synopsis. Go read or something, that's what you're on the site for isn't it?

A/N: Ok, so for those wondering about my other fiction, it's still alive. I plan on continuing it, and I plan on posting the next chapter for it about on or after Christmas. The reason for it was because all of my plans, layout, even outline, as well as some chapters I was suppose to release were deleted thanks to a mishap by my classmate. That really triggered me so I got unmotivated, but I plan on continuing it so don't worry.
Also, I plan on writing this new series, much more because there is no more classes (CHRISTMAS BREAK HERE I COME!!!), sadly, I still have to take a removal exam because I failed one of my subjects (NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!)

But not everyone in Uril is happy.  The holy books speak of elves as the Chosen People of Thesis, tasked with guiding and protecting the lower races.  For some people, this scripture has been interpreted to designate their life as one on the lowest rungs of society.  Humans have been reduced to a slave class, and serve their elven masters under Xandra's rule, kept at bay by the constant fear of the dreaded Emerald Knight, and their own perceived weakness.  Humans do not lead long lives, nor do they possess the wisdom, power, or magical acumen of their elven masters.
But there is hope.  A group of people have banded together to fight against Xandra, her Knight, and her empire.  They call themselves the ""Knights of Order"" united under the principle idea that Xandra's reign has brought chaos unto Xren, and they wish to restore order.  These Knights are led by a man named Xaxac Brigaddon, spoken of as a legend.  They say that when the moons are full, some humans transform into powerful beasts.  They say that Xaxac is the most powerful warrior on Xren, that in his youth he was enslaved and forced to fight other humans to the death in a bloodsport called ""cage fighting"", that he could not be touched and held the world championship title for three years running until he faked his own death and escaped his master to join the resistance.  They say that he has friends in high places- noblemen, pirates, and the devil himself.  They say that if you can find him, he can ferry you to freedom in places where the Earth Elves fear to tread.  They say that he is immune to magical attack, and his eyes shine like the silver moon.  They say that he is descended from Quizlivian Brigaddon, one of the humans who helped the demon Magnus escape a god.
They say that if you want to walk the Path of Order, you should follow the White Rabbit.Come and watch the transformation from human boy to Knight of Order: The life and times of Xaxac OfAgalon OfLangil Brigaddon.
Content Warning: This work is based on the real experiences of human trafficing survivors.  Xaxac's origins are based on true events, and they are presented realisitcally; this includes but is not limited to: isolation, gaslighting, emotional and sexual abuse, and grooming tactics.  This work is meant to hold a mirror up to society; it is based on the real of experiences of people who have experienced slavery and/or abuse.  It is an adult work and probably should not be read by anyone under the age of 18.  If you are a survivor of human trafficing and/or abuse, your feedback is welcome, but please do not read this if you think it may trigger your trauma.  I did not write this with the intention of harming anyone, but rather to provide accurate representation for a group that does not normally get it in the hopes of changing the zeitgeist.  I would like to see a world where more people understand what these experiences are like, so that real survivors do not have to deal with microagressions from an ignorant public.  Reader discretion is advised.  This book does not display these elements as heavily as book 1.",7

29018,Knight and Deserter,"The year is 1039 of Autorm, and nothing has changed. The Knight Seekers still patrol the old highways, death is common in life, and justice is but an afterthought. Power is the unspoken truth, wealth is a means to an end. Anything else becomes irrelevant.

Leondre vae Marras, the fourth son of a Marquis. A prodigy in the Royal Military Academy, and aspiring Knight-errant. Albeit he's still a teenager, naive, and also inexperienced with the outside world. He is also one of the few knights to take the code of Chivalry seriously. 
Then there's Cendric Forrester, the bastard of a decorated Knight. Sold off in servitude to the Order of the Knights Seeker, to unwillingly pay his mothers debt. He's tired of being the Orders pet hound. Ruthless to those standing in his way, and disillusioned with Chivalry and the world around him. Cendric is a survivor, and firmly believes one should have their own self interests in mind.

Author's Note:
Like many folks, I've read one too many web novels. I must admit that they are a guilty pleasure of mine. They're fun, light hearted, and often silly. However, they are a form of literary fast food. And like all fast food, while filling, they aren't very nutritious.
Filth is the Obama Fried Chicken equivalent of a Japanese ""sent to another world"" / ""reincarnated"" light novel. A twist to an old idea, but at its core is much the same. Ultimately this is intended to be a parody of all the various light novels and general pop culture I've consumed in my life. And since I am a lover of comedy, it will primarily be focused on awkward and ridiculous situations. Enjoy.",3

Both challenges to those native to this world, and against other people have come from earth.
Author's comment: I'll be uprfont with you on the entire war thing that the description hints at. Yes it will eventually happen, and many of the strange and out of place things in the beginning will tie into that. Not that it will be explained until much later in the novel. In fact the first 100 or 200 chapters will be spent on the main character growing stronger as an adventurer before the entire war even begins to start rearing its ugly head.
So for those eager for the war to kick off sorry, but there won't be a big explosive war so early. At least not with the empire (although if you read carefully you may be able to pick up signs of how close the war is with what happens in the story). But the wait (I hope) will be worth it as it will be diving into some of the stuff a otherworlder in a significant position of power could do with the right knowledge. With that little warning over with I hope you enjoy this novel of mine. Its my first actual attempt at writing a story for people to read so please keep that in mind.

29091,A World With or Without Aliens,"Nothing matters. It's not my opinion, it's a scientific fact.
This is neither good nor bad, it just... is. I watched my entire country burn, fried on a patriotic pan after some jerk fired a bunch of nukes at the docile fleet of alien ships hovering over us. Who gave this moron such power? I don't know. Everyone involved is most likely dead by now.
As for me, I can't die.  I feel pain like a normal person would (I think), but no matter how terrible the conditions, I will never die or pass out. Fortunately, a lot of alien technology survived its crash to Earth, so I get to spend some time playing with it until Mr. Author gets bored and decides to screw up my life.
Beware, this has a ""harem"" tag. If you haven't figured it out yet, I'm the main character and am therefore subject to this novel's timeline. While this bars me from the sweet ignorance of  Chapter 1's me, it does have other perks... for example, I can tell you that heroine number one is personally responsible for kil-!? H-hey, back off! I'm your character, so if you didn't want  me to be like this, then you should've written me differently!

Randomguy here! In all seriousness, this novel is meant to explore the concept of nihilism as a post-apocalyptic/supernatural-scifi/satire told from a nihilistic introvert's first-person perspective. As you heard from my unsettled main character, each heroine is going to be a different type of horrifying socio/psychopath with dark motives and dangerous abilities (most of which are psychological).
Why would I do something like this? Because I am, in reality, a nihilist who is often frustrated by weird things, like unrealistically dramatic stories, the industrialization of art (specifically music), and people who think swimming in brown creekwater for five hours is a ""fun"" activity. Don't get me wrong, neither me nor my character are depressed, we're just malcontents who make a lot of nerd references.
I feel like the true essence of an ""everything is worthless"" perspective is lost on most pop-culture figures. The closest character I can think of at the moment is Rick from Rick and Morty, who is a drunk, angry nihilist that experienced tremendous loss. I, personally, find this belligerent state of mind to be very relatable, and have incorperated it into every chapter's introduction. Here, the main character talks directly to the reader (and me), shamelessly complaining about some semi-relevant facet of society, which probably doesn't make much sense... it's not really supposed to, though.
These ""angry nihilist"" moments are just a peak into the main character's everyday existence, and also act as miniature rage-journals for me. It will sometimes take a subjectively 'positive' turn, but not very often. This is because reality isn't good or bad, ""it just... is"". I will eventually bring it full-circle to optimistic nihilism, since that seems to be a more practical way to live (and by ""practical"", I mean ""doesn't create mental health issues"").
It is, of course, a satire. I did this because most unnecessarily emotional moments or people usually make me feel kind of awkward, so I decided to mock them. That is, I plan to mock the characteristics about them I don't like in characters based solely off said characteristics. 
Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoy my story!",8

29097,War of the Zwei Kinds [Logbook Deactivated],"It’s the end of the world as humanity knew it. A time where humans and humanoids co-existed. Alien Life forces had no choice but to work together, to save the place they were brought into aeons ago. Aliens, what aliens? They look like us, speak like us, and act like us. Higher intelligence so to speak is truly existent, but with a cost. By working with the humans, they created Guardian Weapons--your every day looking weapons but with a slight shift of using condensed energy instead of typical gunpowder.
However, this wasn't all. A secret governmental team of operatives scouted from all around the world was trying to find a cure for *The Happening*. An endangering disaster which wiped out most of the male species, whether human, animal or any type of sexual reproduction in the other kingdoms. Equipped with weapons of bio-destruction, they will mow down the terrorist groups, the hidden organizations, and any other party--that tries to stop their freedom and rights.

""Mortals that hold thy heads higher than the very heavens. Thy species hath conquered nothing but a mere lesser planet and yet feel as if thee hath reached the peak of the food chain. Thy ignorance is laughable and thy wisdom is void of any existence. But thy desire to stand above all others is of an extreme.
This sort of situation is... unprecedented but... this one shall grace thee with an exception. Many of yee art discontent with thy lives and wish for change. In that case, this one shall grant thee that change and put thy race back... where it belongs.""
... is the last thing every human on earth heard on the 25th of December 2020 which later came to be known as ""The Lost Christmas"". The fateful day on which every human on earth was suddenly thrust into a new planet where they suddenly found themselves at the very bottom of the food chain.

29172,Paragons,"The year is 2030. Superheroes have existed for a long time. Heroic figures that stand among the rest to fight evil. Villainous figures that wish others harm for personal gain. This is the world that's been known since World War II, a world where seeing a man flying in the sky is viewed as a common sight.
Five years ago, the Cray Act went into effect, replacing the old ways of vigilantism with a government authorized, sanctioned, and legitmatized form of crimefighting sponsored under the Superhuman Enforcement Agency, or the SEA.
The world always teeters on the edge of destruction, and it's the heroes who make the difference. But in this moment, where cape politics are divided, and the legality of the super is an ongoing concern, the matter of what's right and what's wrong is an oft-asked question.
Few have asked this more than Blindshot. A former member of the Paragons, a former vigilante, a former inmate, recently released by the SEA, for a purpose. He is to train and guide a group of young heroes, or ""cadets"", to become crimefighters of their own. It's easier said than done, and when push comes to shove, one must make the decision, and then ask if it's the right one.

This is a story of superheroes, one with extensive worldbuilding and focus on the characters' personal lives as much as the action itself.
Features multiple POVs, shifting focus as needed, but the focus will be small scale at first before growing in scale as it progresses.
Current release schedule is 3-5 chapters a week, though it might be slower at certain times. During which, I'll leave a warning.
Chapters will average at around 2.5k words, sometimes more, sometimes less.

Michael Freeman is a disabled veteran who had just been fired from his mind-numbing cubicle job, which allowed his opportunistic girlfriend to dump him. Now, he only wants to spend some time in his grandfather's mountain cabin to unwind away from the drudgery of daily life with a cold beer in his hands.
Standing in his way is an ancient spaceship with an emotional AI, nanites that have invaded his body, an international crime syndicate, a suicidal FBI agent on a vigilante mission, terrorists... and this is just the beginning.
What can one man do when faced with insurmountable odds? Call it quits? Or… call some of his old army buddies and blow those obstacles to smithereens.
Can he become more than he had ever dreamed, reaching further than any man before? Staying under the radar of the powers that be while righting a few wrongs of the modern world.
He is sure of three things:
1. He really doesn’t want to follow the rules anymore... aside from his own.
2. Space is the ultimate frontier, and he had been given a turnkey technology to reach it—if they let him.
3. Those that want to hurt him and the people he cares about will rue the day they were born.
You do not always get what you wish for… sometimes, you get one hell of a lot more.

Is there any point in having a body that's made out of mana if it means you can't interact with anything? Sure, you might be able to cast magic and topple over nature itself, but what's the point with that if you can't even celebrate it with a good, cold drink?",7

Can I apply my medical knowledge to become a famous doctor in this world too or will I find another reason to use my knowledge? Will I once again ignore those who love me or will I learn another purpose to life?

This two wheeled mare, of iron and steel, was my sole means of transportation for almost 5 years. Rain, sleet, snow, or hundred degree heat, it didn't matter, I was in the saddle. We went all over this side of the Mississippi together. To places long forgotten by progress or filled to their capacity with humanity.
Interesting word humanity, it means all off human kind in one definition, generosity and compassion in another. How often these two definitions are at bitter odds with the other, is something to be seen.
These words are a mash up. Tales of the road.

29247,livE within,"What do you do when you realize the whole world is slowly crumbling before you? You fight back, knowing that if you try hard enough you may be able to return to your nice, peaceful life.
This story, unfortunately, is centered around a spineless wimp who doesn't want to fight back. Everything he worked so hard for gets destroyed and yet he does absolutely nothing. The sight is sickening...that's why I have taken pity on him. I'll force him to put on his war paint, to FIGHT. I'm gonna change him like a remix, then he'll be reborn like a phoenix so he can take the world back from the heart attack that it suffered! Why am I doing this NOW?
Because all of his flaws are now aligned with this mood of mine! IT'S IRRESISTABLE!~
The main character is a young 20-year-old Japanese man who has the usual low-paying office job. He isn't dumb by any means, he is most certainly a genius, but because of his weak will and shy personality, he is forced to be what he is today.  One day, something takes pity on him and gives him the possibility to change his fate by sleeping. I know that sounds weird but it's true!~
Why did I choose him?  Because when I saw this timid powerless Japanese boy try to save a life, it inspired me to act too. There are stories about every hero, how they became great, but most have 1 thing in common. Their bodies moved before they had a chance to think, almost on their own. For some reason, I remembered my mother's words in that moment when I saw him "" I'm sorry ###, I wish things were different..."" and in that day, that's what happened to him. This kid was exactly like me...You know, back then, my mom never told me the thing I wanted her to say, NO, the thing that I needed to hear...""###, you too can become what your heart desires!"". I will make that boy feel what he needs to hear. I won't let him fall...not like me.

Did you think my dream wasn’t childish? The best dreams most often are. No? Well, maybe you just don’t dream big enough. Ever think about that?
Dreams are never easy to follow, and neither is mine. There are millions of players who want the same as I do, but very few would actually risk their future trying. Following the path of a Villain isn’t easy, and I have a city filled with thousands of players who would love to see me fail.
I will show them though. Just you wait and see...

Far in the past, there was a civilization much more advanced than the one of modern times. Evidence of that time remains, but it is all but shrouded in mystery as there remains no way to decipher it. Currently, normal individuals wage war with guns and smaller machinery, but those who can wield a higher power vary in their abilities. Scales, born upon humans, are a mystery in their origins but are the source of their abilities and their way towards advancement. Although normally powerless, humans have adapted to the scales and thus can connect with the power of the universe, much like the other races that inhabit its various corners.
In one of these corners, there exists a human settlement where Lancing follows his father's footsteps to begin his own ascent to power. However, he finds he is far different from his gifted father, whose scales below his eyes were among the purest ever seen, reaching gem-like quality. Far from perfect, Lancing shows no desire to give up and ceaselessly moves forward to reach the peak of the universe.

29280,Little Death [Dark Paranormal Fated Mates Romance],"Not quite immortal, but certainly not human, Tabitha and Sam blended in for years as a seemingly normal couple—hitting the bars together, scraping out a living on the edge of society, never revealing that the violent ends of their human lives long ago rebirthed them as elemental beings known as the Mara: a succubus and an incubus.
But when a mutual mistake brings down punishment upon them, forcing them to separate, each loses the only thing that matters—their lover, partner, and soul mate. Tabitha, determined to placate the beings who control her fate, takes to the streets of New York City to find a long-lost relic she hopes will win their favor. By night, she pursues the dreamers who welcome her into their beds and, sometimes, their wallets.
Sam, despondent and struggling, escapes deeper and deeper into a relationship with a human woman enchanted with him. Hiding what he truly is, he could risk all he has left—until a new revelation changes everything, and he will have Tabitha back no matter the cost.
LITTLE DEATH is a spicy, dark paranormal romance with fated mates, hidden shifter identities, a strong heroine, a wounded hero, and a powerful reunion/redemption arc.",26

   ""What's worse? Something bad, or nothing at all?""


You're casing your fifth attempted murder case in only as many days and you've lost count of the number of petty crimes you've had to investigate. You can't stop thinking about how you missed your one chance to cuff the Dead Ice Killer for good and you haven't been able to sleep easy since. You haven't been able to give yourself a decent buzz either because of your new and unique metabolism, and not one of the villages around for miles sell a nice cigar. No matter how effective you are, or how many cases you solve, you can't catch a break with the civvies, who seem to bounce between fearing you and hating you with little in-between. To make things worse, the newly appointed D.A. has been up your ass constantly due to your allegedly 'risky, lone soldier, loose-cannon' style of law enforcement.
It's been a rough week.
Your name is John Ratman, and you are a rat. That's right, a rat. Not a man-rat, or a rat-man, though the name Ratman is kind of misleading, so you could understand if someone got a bit confused. Now, it must be understood, you aren't a rat in the sense that you snitch often, or because you lie a lot. No, you are a rat in the sense that you are physically a rat of unusually large size. It must be said you aren't even that unusually large, either, you're about the size of one of those little toy poodles the rich girls used to haul around back home. Your 'menacing' physique is best fit for scaring old maids into jumping onto the nearest stool and shooting fire magic at you, and little else. Not for fighting back, of course, because it turns out that rats are still susceptible to being burnt to death, no matter how big or hefty they get.
You are also the Damned City of Oreholm's last and only line of defense against the looming threat of 'mandatory evacuation' from the King of Ellendir.
What's one Ratman to do?

Note to Readers: This is essentially fan-fiction for my own series Sword of the Bright Lady, which is published by Pyr and available from Amazon or any other reputable book dealer. This is a story I don't think I could ever sell to a publisher but one I wanted to write, and I think the audience here at Royal Road are perhaps the only people who would ever want to read it.
Be aware that the first chapter has some pretty serious spoilers for the series, though after that it diverges into its own story line.
Also note this story, like Sword of the Bright Lady, is only LitRPG adjacent; there are no character sheets or virtual games, but the magic of the world of Prime functions in many ways exactly like a table-top roleplaying game. For instance, people on Prime routinely talk about what class to take for their next level.
If you are interested in how this all works in an RPG I have a ton of free game supplements on DriveThruRPG for D&D 3.5 (just google for Heroes of Prime by MC Planck to get started).

A man. His ex-girlfriend's cat. A sadistic game show unlike anything in the universe: a dungeon crawl where survival depends on killing your prey in the most entertaining way possible.In a flash, every human-erected construction on Earth—from Buckingham Palace to the tiniest of sheds—collapses in a heap, sinking into the ground.The buildings and all the people inside have all been atomized and transformed into the dungeon: an 18-level labyrinth filled with traps, monsters, and loot. A dungeon so enormous, it circles the entire globe.Only a few dare venture inside. But once you're in, you can't get out. And what's worse, each level has a time limit. You have but days to find a staircase to the next level down, or it's game over. In this game, it's not about your strength or your dexterity. It's about your followers, your views. Your clout. It's about building an audience and killing those goblins with style.You can't just survive here. You gotta survive big.You gotta fight with vigor, with excitement. You gotta make them stand up and cheer. And if you do have that ""it"" factor, you may just find yourself with a following. That's the only way to truly survive in this game—with the help of the loot boxes dropped upon you by the generous benefactors watching from across the galaxy.They call it Dungeon Crawler World. But for Carl, it's anything but a game.

There are those who remember, and those who do not. I’ll spare you the technical explanation — that’s what we have teachers for. The jist is as follows: those who remember are... how do I put this... more likely. They occupy more time. and the space that time has allowed them — the pertinent amount — is experienced no matter what. Allow me to offer you a bit of personal information: I am not one who remembers. There is no time relevant to me, no space that I occupy.

You are her food. She uses you as her own personal buffet and she indulges herself quite often. You even have the permanent scars to prove it. You have learned many things from her, mostly without her knowing, since you have been helping more and more with her spell work the last few years and her potion making. The only parts you can't do are the magic condensing rituals that her potions require and the mana infusions that a lot of her other creations need.

29399,Kibo: The New Age of Cornith,"In 2202 A.D. the satellite, radar, and energy sensory technology of world governments allowed them to discover ""Mana"". One could absorb this Mana through the use of their penial gland and store in their brain before channeling it through one's body.
 
Along with the discovery of this, the entire world united and focused most of its resources into researching it. They began investing in devices worth trillions of US dollars. These devices could detect and track the flow of Mana and they used them to try to better understand its properties.
 
They soon realized however that Earth had pitifully low amounts of Mana on it and had no discernable use.
 
When people started to lose faith in the entire project  African American Scientist; Gideon Kingston discovered that there would occasionally be strange surges of Mana which at first glance were in no way connected.
 
He gathered some of his friends; Alexander Bishop, Selina, and Geoffry Winchester, Dennis Lancel, Andrew Ventura, Penelope Silva, and Eleanor Tesla. All of them, giants in their fields of science who had risen to prominence within the last 20 years. 
 
They pooled all of their resources and eventually came to discover that each time these ""Mana surges"" took place someone had vanished never to be seen again. They then came to the conclusion that these people were being summoned to other worlds by forces beyond their current realm of understanding and power.
 
When this news was released to the world panic ensued. Some people feared that at any moment they could be summoned and never see their loved ones again, some wanted to try to develop countermeasures against the summoning, others knew that there was no way to stop it and simply gave up hope, and others still were excited (Of course it was the Otakus). 
 
As governments once again focused resources into studying Mana and Magic Gideon ad his friends became absorbed in finding a solution to what had been dubbed ""The Call"". 2 years later they announced the invention of an object which could be implanted within an infant's cerebrum.   
 
They called it Kibo the Japanese word for hope. They named it so because they found the core material for its creation; a metal called Mithril on one of Japan's colony planets: Zenith and it served as a safety net for those summoned by ""The Call"".
 
The Kibo would fuse with an infant and growing alongside it. It would remain dormant for most people's lives as it would only activate when its host was affected by ""The Call"". When the host was summoned the Kibo would completely fuse with the host. The Kibo would release Mana into the host's body that it had absorbed from the surrounding's of the host while dormant. The Kibo would use this ability in tandem with data it collected on the host and the new world the latter had been summoned to alter the DNA of the host.
 
The vast majority jumped at the opportunity to offer their children any form of refuge in the case that ""The Call"" came for them. Yet, some feared the Kibo because of its capabilities to read minds and fundamentally alter its host. Governments soon passed laws forcing every infant to receive a Kibo as it was the only way to ensure the safety of future generations.
 
Now, nearly 100 years later many massive breakthroughs have been made in regards to the understanding of Mana, and now the youngest generation of the Kibo's Inventors has been summoned to a world called Cornith.

thank you for reading, now for the summary....


For months Mark has been bugging his friends to try this gaming system he is enamored with. Skills, Archetypes, and Demons. This system has a skill for everything and even different approaches for some skills. Instead of levels, he tells them, each skill has its own experience and level.
""As true to real life as a gaming system could be."" at least it says on the box. When the group finally break down and decide to play it, they head over to Hunter's house to start. Next thing they know... trapped in the game.
Everyone dreams of being trapped inside their favorite game. Abusing the mechanics and becoming OP AF. No one ever dreams of being trapped in a crappy system. One ladened with rules and so much record keeping it almost becomes tedious.

Oh how I bit my nails, hiding behind the old oak door. Concentrating on her ever word, her tone, anticipating what she would say. The seconds felt like hours, slowly creeping on, as I waited for her response... and the before I could even hold a complete thought she replied.
'She's my mother, how could she even think of that possibility,' I thought joking nervously.

Tags may be removed or added to this story as it progresses.  For example, I added the harem tag because I wasn't sure if it would appear so be forewarned.  Also, productive feedback is always appreciated even if it may be ignored. 
Note 2: Original idea inspired by ""Arrogant Young Master Template A Variation 4"".   I wanted to do something similar but have a more gritty realistic feel.  The system SHOULD differentiate as the story goes on but if it doesn't it means I need a rewrite.  Either way, read AYMTV4, it's great.

Author’s note: A fair warning.
This is the first time I’ve published anything, and basically the first time I’ve written anything more than mandatory school-stuff. The story will probably have inconsistencies, grammatical errors (not my native tongue, though that excuse is getting old), and potentially confusing (missing?) plot. I will naturally do my best to write something worth reading, but my main goal in writing this story is to have fun and explore the limits of my own creativity. My hope in publishing it here, is that I’ll reach someone who enjoy the story, and can push me forward towards writing more, as it is difficult at times to find the motivation to write just for myself. 

Additionally, I can’t really promise to have regular updates, as I have a full-time job that often likes to take the ‘full-time’ part literally, and a sporadic social life that occasionally surprises me (happy surprises mostly, so I shouldn’t complain). I’ll aim for once a week to start with, and take it from there. 

Happy reading!

DM's note(for the outsider looking in): Over the summer of 2019, i had the pleasure of running a couple rpg campaigns within my friend group. Both campaigns took place in a mutual homebrew setting that involved elements of both systems being DMed - D&D 5e and Numenera - but diluted so as to be compatible. Due to my growing investment in this new setting, I felt like I wanted to tell more stories in it (in addition to future campaigns), and its scope (cosmically speaking) grew quite out of hand (comically) - speaking of which: this work originally took form as Fanfiction, in much the same way most inspirations do. The mentioned dilution and subsequent out-of-handedness…-ing means that any such setting elements have been distorted (via that beautiful creative fusion dance known as brainstorming) so that this work can no longer be considered a proper ""Dungeons and Dragons fanfic"" or ""Numenera fanfic."" Any resemblance to tabletop rpg systems living or dead has become… tangential and referential at best. However, the avenue of more blatantly incorporating such elements remains open, meaning the work may topple into the realm of fanfiction at any moment's notice.
DM's note(for the outsider looking in): I expect to foster this setting for some time as I continue to hone the craft of writing, but I hope to also, in the future, tell stories within it that are more fairly inviting to any reader. What do I mean? Well…(the rest of this note prefaces the first chapter as the description has only so much space)
DM's note(for the player looking out): If any of my players are reading this, don't get any funny ideas… I make the jokes in this household, no matter how bad they are.
Author’s note: I have no idea what I’m doing. How are you doing today? Can I cheer you up or help you grieve?

Memento I of The Divine Yard :05:
The Timeless ones wake to discover themselves upon the doorstep of a new Epoch. With a new dawn, the cycles of new magics begin to tick onward, earlier than they ever have before.
Disastrous forces already seek to claim them, but there is always a critical point. With Unlimited potential, each Epoch wells up and bursts with the new - new storms, new gateways… new heroes.
Solace and resolution inevitably lie with those who, even unwittingly, choose to take up the mantle of being an era's hero.
That mantle avails itself to anyone. Perhaps…
…the exile, cast out for being unlawfully chosen?…the mutilated, scarred by a mistake not her own?…the assassin, unable to accept redemption?…or the innovator, hiding a past blotted by the demons - bound by an experiment yet in stasis?
A resolution made so long ago is hard to remember, let alone keep.

Amalia Sylvia-Sigrid Lehtinen has memories of a past life from some seven hundred years ago.

Now that this story is marked 'completed', I'll be going through each chapter and fleshing out the story a bit, as I found it severely lacking, and I've been saying to myself ""I could have done more with that.""  way more often than I should be.  And that speaks to my own dissatisfaction with my writing.  I make no warranty-express or implied-as to the quality of these chapters, or the story as a whole.

Book two (ends Chapter 71) will eventually undergo a large developmental edit as it's a much weaker book overall and lacks a good impetus (the stuck-in-dungeon reviews are somewhat accurate here in their view of the disconnect to the outside.) I intend to end in the same place. It just needs work and especially in the reduction effort. So, please bear with me.

29603,One Look Man,"If you though one punch to defeat anyone was overpowered, one look is just broken beyond broken.
I’m just your typical student attending school while keeping my head down and minding my own business. Unfortunately there are endless streams of weirdos everywhere I go. A bunch of old guys old enough to be my father or even grandfather run around pretending that they’re heroes or something.
It’s honestly so embarrassing that I can’t bear to look at them. Well... that’s not quite true I can’t bare to look at them for another reason altogether. All I can do is look at the ground at all times fearful I’ll make a mistake. To completely dominate someone regardless of gender with one looks is just too dangerous for both them and me.
It’s truly the worst double edged sword being too strong.
Anyways heroes don’t exist in this world. They run around like kids acting like them to relive their childhood. That’s the only thing I can think of it being. After all I’m a down to earth person fully aware of my surroundings. Not only that, but how can they be heroes when they’re such pushovers that one look from me is enough for them to fall to their knees?
Could it be my awe inspiring half bald head? Perhaps it’s the majestic long scruffy beard. No, maybe it’s even my beautiful eyes.
Well whatever it may be I really wish these damn old farts would grow up and stop playing heroes with each other. I just want to live a quiet peaceful life in my very normal school, S.H. Academy.",3
29605,A Demon's Tail,"He was born in a dark place, in a world where souls were traded like coins and a person's life wouldn't amount to much. A world where a single misspoken promise could rip you to shreds. On top of everything, his only soul was acting up and mocking him!
It couldn't get much worse in his opinion...

Author's Comment:
I was asked about reading my work on other sites. The answer is simple: Currently, I am not active in any other networks than royalroadl.com. Only here, I correct mistakes and errors. If you read it anywhere else and have to pay for it or have to deal with an annoying amount of advertisement, You Are Being Betrayed. You would do good if you make other people in that network aware of it. This is a free project of mine for the purpose of having fun. And if people try to make money with it you shouldn't bother visiting their website.

Edit: If you don’t get the timeline that’s because the rate at which time flows in different worlds are not equal. In addition, timelines do not neccesarily run parallel to each other, they may cascade such that when summoned to another world you may get summoned from a different reference frame in the timeline of another world’s with respect to your own.
Scientific constants can change from one plane to the next. The natural laws that govern each world is not necessarily the same across them all.

29738,Loner Boy & Lonely Girl,"""Loner is not a lonely""
Leo a loner boy with a tragic past, lives his life like the way he wants, no one talks with him, he doesn't talk with anyone and he thrives on loneliness. With his unique mindset, he has the ability to judge people on their behaviour and tell how human relations work at an instinctual level.

But he's loner life is about to be in a turmoil when he meets a  beautiful and hot girl called Chelsea who, with a mindset completely opposite of Leo, with ability, even she has yet to discover but is pulled back by her shortcomings. (she couldn't talk with people, she has what we call anthrophobia)

Join this funny journey where a loner teaches a lonely to become social. And a lonely, not knowingly teaches a loner about the good side of life. Of course, there will be fun character's other than our loner and lonely who will play an important part in their already stiff journey.

29760,Zeroth Knight re: Dawn,"Isekai, fantasy, with the core themes of Identity and Fate.       Story contains a, mostly, lesbian cast.
Updated twice a day.

Evangeline Sayagawa makes the ultimate choice at the cost of the ultimate sacrifice: She decides to leave her world that she fought so hard to return to, and return to Arsea in hopes of saving everyone. Little was she aware of just how bad things had gotten. The world she was returning to was cast into chaos and on the precipice of being destroyed. She awakens in this new kind of Arsea, after having witness the end of a dear friend. The world now belonged to the monstrosities of old, the Beta, and their corrupted human warriors, the Eld.
 
With her fake identity, that which defined her in this world, being stripped from her, she now has to navigate a darkness in which not even the women she loves recognize her.

This is book 2 of the Evangeline Sayagawa ""Zeroth Knight"" story, with book 1 being found here.
The first ""chapter"" posted here is a hyper-condensed version of volume/book 1, in case anyone needs a generalized refresher of events, or for those who wish to start with this book instead as it is faster paced and more action-packed than the first one. Suffice to say, but most of the details from book 1 are lost by doing this; however, enough of the more-important information is present to allow one to understand the general idea of what is going on.
This book features a mostly lesbian cast and deals more so with fate and crises of identity more than anything else. However, there is much more action in this one than any of my other stories thus far and brings about the end of Evangeline Sayagawa's story arch... sort of.
I have another story up, a short story drama with light yuri and supernatural themes: ""Escape The KNIGHT""

Karth was a prisoner minding his own business, just trying to serve out his sentence. Called upon against his will, Karth was summoned to another world.

Soon he finds himself with a noble title he did not want, caught in the middle of a war that was not his, court intrigues, power struggles, and a forced marriage.

29802,Astraea the Faceless,"What does it take to defeat a great evil?
Since ancient times, two Great Gods of Light and Darkness have fought for dominance over the world. Yet, after many countless epochs the Goddess of Light had succumbed to the Great Darkness and unfortunately passed away. In her final moments, with a grieving heart for the many innocents she would leave behind, she summoned a worthy Hero to become a shield for the world. At the behest of the Goddess this Female Hero accepted the mantle and began a centuries long crusade against the Great Darkness.
However, even with the divine powers granted upon her by the Goddess, it was still not enough. With no alternatives, the Female Hero brought over three Heroes like herself to this world to aid her. For a time, they fought valiantly, and it all seemed like it would be over soon. Perhaps the world could be saved after all.
That vision of victory was never meant to be. Even the combined powers of four Heroes proved insufficient. One by one, the Heroes fell and died on a world they never knew existed until they came.
Finally, in the same manner as the ancient Goddess of Light all those years ago, so too did the First Hero fall. In her footsteps, the Female Hero, with her dying strength, decided to pull out one final trump card.
So, what does it take to truly defeat an undefeatable evil?  
There was an old saying from where she came from: Fight Fire with Fire. Evil with Evil.
The final Hero… was no Hero. What the world really needed was a villain: Astraea the Faceless.",14

Starting with nothing wasn’t new for him, and as before, he would forge ahead into this unfamiliar land of abnormalities, monsters, and magic.

So the world ended. Whoopsie? We didn’t even see it coming. Quite literally as it came at us faster than the speed of light. Don’t worry though, it got better. Also, I am not joking about the world ending. Most people say that and mean humans are inconvenienced for some reason. Nope, all matter disintegrated at the atomic scale there for a few moments. Apparently the local universe wasn’t actually stable? Don’t ask me to go into too much detail. It would require both of us to have a few more college degrees than sense, and I at least lack them (both the degrees and the sense). Anyway, the energy/matter/wibbly wobbly strings were at a local minimum and not the universal minimum. Basically, what we took for sea level was actually a nice little mountain lake and when the dam busted so did, well, everything.
Now here is where things go a bit off track with what normal meant before. You see magic is real, qi is real, gods are real. Not on old Earth mind you but souls pay little attention to time and space so we dreamed of it. In fact, the closer the shift in reality got to Earth, the closer our dreams got to the new reality. This is basically me tip toeing around the fact that it was a ‘System Apocalypse’. Reality became a video game, I became a dungeon, and this is my story.

Doyle Huxley just wanted a normal life but as the above might clue you in on that just isn’t in the cards. He gets to experience a “Path Based System Apocalypse” and some early paths he takes, both literally and figuratively, lead to him becoming a dungeon.

A spire of brilliant light pierced the sky, and as the land was torn asunder, the demon emperor met his death. It was not by the hands of a hero, or goddess’ champion, but by a system developer—a creator of the VRMMO Ark World—masquerading as a god!
“It’s ironic that it would be you,” said a voice in the black void of the quantum system. “Strange, that you’ve given me this quest, and stranger that I can’t do it without you.”
By the power of the thirteenth system developer, the “goddess” Amarytha, the demon emperor was reborn in a new video game where his character never came to be. In the Ark World Sandbox, humans rule as gods over nations of NPCs. Through mastery of their administration commands, they hold absolute control. Only the demon emperor, liberated by the Player System, can challenge them.

>This is an Action-Romance Fantasy Story. I won't follow the rules of the throne inheritance, also the rules of the king / prince / princess has to be protected, instead I will make them wield weapons and bring them to the front lines.

Expect quality fluctuations. -((( Useful feedback is much appreciated. ))) -This will have a harem since my last story didn't have one. --Expect badly written lemon scenes.

 ___________________________________To help answer some questions people might have.
- No beast companions and as of right now no plans for beast companions. (But then again Hela does have Fenris...)- No kingdom-building,- The beginning of the story puts a lot of people off because I didn't go the normal route people would like, and they don't tend to like the troll arc.- He also starts a little rash and seems a little weak because his powers easily drain him, some of this is explained later though and fixed by Gaea, but many miss this and only concentrate on the fact that he isn't being and doing what they think he should.- I should also explain that he has some memories that were locked away and then deleted because of his rashness. This was simply a way to end the whole locked memory thing, the Acanti soul was a plot point to give him future memories of the MCU, beyond that it served no more purpose so I got rid of all the other useless knowledge, He was in no way nerfed as some would like to believe.- I made him a little more emotional then I would like at the beginning, it was my attempt at trying to give him a personality after being criticized for the lack thereof in my last story. - Ruthless? I don't think so, I'm going more the route of a fair Mc. He'll do more of an eye for an eye type stuff, gender does not matter to him when it comes to this.- While the harem isn't the end all be all goal, it's true that he's going around getting women.- I do have a story beyond the harem though and will not focus too heavily on the harem beyond the obvious. Mostly he just goes around sleeping with them and beyond that is anyone's guess whether they stick around or not, I do try and make it feel a little more real, but it is a harem. ___________________________________

Mason Courbis is a 33 year-old man living in Midwest America who works a (somewhat) decent job and enjoys spending time playing tabletop games with his friends on weekends. He also happens to be part of an incredibly small minority of people capable of feeling and using magic. In an otherwise mundane world, Mason endeavors to seek out and collect magical artifacts in lieu of pursuing any sort of major life goal or career. He manages to lead an interesting and enjoyable life— until he is suddenly struck dead by a car.
When he finds himself reincarnated into a fantasy world, Mason learns that he is the descendant of a powerful mage, and is roped into helping the unorganized people of Hsura defend and liberate themselves from an invading force known as the Autarchy of Xoul. Mason is then presented with an impressive set of enchanted heirloom plate armor, as well as a mythical Excalibur-esque weapon; he promptly rejects both of these items in favor of a simple cloak and dagger. Mason resigns to disassemble the Autarchy through stealth, subterfuge, and systematic assassination, all the while keeping his identity completely hidden from everyone.
After realizing that he's committed himself to an agonizingly lonely life, Mason decides to live a double-life as an alter ego. Using a magical spell, he physically alters his body into that of a strong, charismatic young woman, and calls himself Kai Freecrest; ""Kai Freecrest,"" is in all aspects the polar opposite of ""Mason Courbis,"" in an attempt to keep his true identity permanently secret. Over time, however, it becomes more difficult for him/her to determine which identity really is their ""true"" identity.",19

The changed chapters will be altered after they are done. 

Book 2 of Eri's journey in Yellow Springs Being reincarnated into a new world sounds like a thing of fantasy. Having magic that mimics the processes of a game makes this new world seem even more unreal. This world is real, and it's not all harems and Guild shinanigans. There is a darker side to every society and Eri finds himself smack in the middle of a mystery. Eri goes off to deal with a new mysterious monster that is causing a dangerous migration of Red Wolves. While he's gone a darkness descends on Yellow Springs. The newly killed are being changed into Undead. They walk the forests and appear in the middle of town. Yellow Springs is under attack and the mental strain of having to kill the monster that used to be your best friend is leaving the town in chaos.

Some time ago, a planes-traveling archmage made up a video game to train some people on the planet Earth for the catastrophe he knew was coming.
That game was the Power of Ten.
The gods seized this opportunity to take the templates of some of those characters, and even their souls, for use in other worlds, and other realms.
Sama Rantha is one of those characters, and is going to find out that being a Hagchild and having to survive after your Hag Curse fails to murder you at birth is much, much less fun than setting it as your Race at level One on a gamescreen.
Join Sama Rantha on her Road to Ten, and letting her Hagmother know exactly what she thinks of her...

Warning: This book starts with a HARD OPEN! It was written as an extension of other stories that have not made it onto the Internet yet for National Novel Writing Month in Nov/2018.
Book One/Sama Rantha: A traditionalist LitRPG in the fantasy world vein. The beginning chapters will be heavy with gaming terms and the supporting math as Sama exploits the rules as much as possible, minmaxing her heart out to get one up on the world trying to kill her.
The math and rules lawyering tapers off, but are never eliminated, as Sama is going to do everything she can to exploit the rules of reality here and not die, while making sure those responsible for this get exactly what is coming to them...
