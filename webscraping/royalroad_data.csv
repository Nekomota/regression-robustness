Two strangers looking down at the abyss that mankind in the past, feared, and in the present, forgot. And from the abyss they once again begin their slow but unstoppable crawl to the surface.

10002,The Observer's Notebook: The Dungeon Gods Edition,"The Observer' Notebook: The Dungeon Gods Edition, is a hub for information about my other story, The Dungeon Gods, that is not important enough to have to be posted inside the story, and also cannot be nicely fitted into the story without breaking it completely.
    Within this Notebook, one can find a great deal of information, and if they wish to know about something not already mentioned, they can request it specifically. This will update pretty much whenever I feel like it, so don't expect regular releases.",22

10004,The Ocean Flame Palace Host,"Schedule: I am officially going on an indefinite hiatus. Sorry to all readers but I just don't have any more ideas.
Hai Yun is the youngest Divine Rank Alchemist on the Scarlet Flame continent. He was an orphan picked up by a wandering Alchemist Grand master and raised in the Crystal Ocean Alchemy Sect. As he soon got bored of refining other people’s recipes, he started creating his own. One such recipe was of an elixir that can allow one to retain their memories through reincarnation.
He thought this heaven defying elixir could bring about a new golden age for alchemists, to let them keep all of their experience after death. However  it only brings about a calamity as the other powers of the martial world immediately begin lusting after this divine object. They attack the Crystal Ocean Alchemy Sect en masse, razing it to the ground. To keep them from getting it, Hai Yun devours the Elixir and obliterates his body so they can never even find another trace of it in this world.
However, in his reincarnation a series of very interesting things happen…

10009,Crimson Path,"A boy, born at an unfortunate time, in an unfortunate world, has to grow up with a foster father that perhaps killed too much in his life, and in the end leaves the boy to grow up alone in a world that could not care less about him or anyone but the strong. He will go through a childhood of blood and grow into a man who has found his peace after a life of murder, lies, cheats, and the oppression of a world big enough to house multitudes of empires and endless amounts of mysteries.

This is my first ever literature. I will make no commitments, or schedules. I will write as much and as long as I can. I may never finish the story, or I may finish it prematurely. But I will try to make it as interesting as I can.  This story is pretty much written on the go, I have a direction where I want to head, but no real path that I will tread.
Also the title may or may not fit the story so it may change at some point.",0
10010,Shameless Hero,"Shameless Hero Summary
 
The sound of swords clashing, magical barriers shaken, men and women screaming in pain, the ground shaking leaving deep pits on what used to be a prosperous land, arrows piercing through bodies and heads, and burning buildings and fields. In different places not far from each other, one man or woman were fighting to death against 10 masked men.
Just right outside the valley, a young boy, who seemed to be almost reaching the adult age, was leading a bunch of boys and girls towards home. 
""Big brother Ye Tian, can we catch some fireflies when we get home?"" one of the girls asked.
Ye Tian, who was the leader of that group walking home, happened to hear a painful battle towards the direction they're walking towards to. Sensing danger and fear, Ye Tian safely hid his younger siblings from what seems to be a bandit raid. Afterwards, he ran straight home alone as quickly as he could, only to see a massacre happening in his home. He quickly searched for his parents to help get rid of the invaders, however, he got terribly wounded. Unable to move from the swords stabbing his back and legs, he could only open his eyes and witness his parents and all the villagers being massacred! 
The flames raged on throughout the night burning everything into ashes leaving no evidence behind. Within the sea of flames, a piercing light appeared as bright as the heavens completely covering Ye Tian from the sea of flames.
By the time Ye Tian opened his eyes, only confusement, pain, sadness, and a mystery filled his mind. He was lucky to be alive, but what no one knew except for himself was that he was running out of time!
 

 
Note
I’m an amateur writer. Simple as that. I hated writing unless it was for school assignments. But I definitely love daydreaming, narrating stories revolving around heroes, adventures, humor, and a touch of romance. My grammar is average at best, but I have decided to give it a try. Please bear with me.
This is a Xianxia story, which is basically an ancient Chinese mythology meets video games meets fantasy. 
 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I have two goals for writing this:

Improve on my grammar as I continue to write more and more chapters.
A story that many people can enjoy!

I hope everyone will be entertained with this story. If anyone is willing to proof-read and revise my grammar, please contact me. I'll be writing a minimum of 5 chapters per week. If you have some feedback, I’m all ears!

10016,Life in the New World,"On the Hiatus: I began writing this novel when I was, in all honesty, very bad at writing. I hope to revisit creative writing in the near future and I plan to, at some point in time, revisit this. I am flattered that many people have taken the time to read this story, but it is not what I intend to start with, as it will likely need a hard rewrite in order to correct many of the more glaring issues it has.

Join our hero and follow his exciting adventure through a newly changed world!
 
WARNING their will be violence,  profanity,, and gore in this fiction. if any of these make you uncomfortable this is not a story for you turn around and walk away now!!!",167
10017,Wall Breaker,"Hello, this is my first time ever doing something like this. Im not going to lie, I am still a little new to this writing thing. I hope to write more in the future. It would make me do something productive in my spare time other than doing nothing. In this story, what I tried to do was something meta. It's about a editor/writer who is close to losing is job. He finds a book, but the book isn't like any normal book. The book is alive, it's aware that it's a book and it has lived on for generations. Seeing this opportunity, the main character decides to take his career into his own hands and write a story of his own to publish. However, the pressure of all that he faces makes him Spiral out of control. However, what you read was never real. In fact it's just the story that the main character wrote, he never went through any of it.",0
